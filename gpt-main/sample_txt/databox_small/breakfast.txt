Tartine, San Francisco: French bakery. Everything is amazing, but their basic pasty items (e.g. croissant, kouign-amann, Danish) are their strongest strength.

Trouble Coffee, San Francisco: Oddball bakery. An SF institution and supposedly the originator of the Expensive Toast craze. Try the cinnamon sugar toast and definitely listen to the relevant episode of This American Life as you drive up there.

Brendaâ€™s French Soul Food, San Francisco: American Southern/Cajun. Not solely a breakfast place, but the brunch is to die for (and if you have heart problems, may actually kill you!). The beignet flight is particularly charming.

Backhaus, San Mateo: German-ish bakery. Brands itself as mainly about bread, but the delicious coffee and pastries are the main attraction. Very cute courtyard seating.

Manresa Bread, Los Gatos: French bakery. Coffee and pastries, backed by the pastry chef from a 3-star Guide Michelin restaurant. Come early or miss out on the best stuff!

Orchard City Kitchen, Campbell: New American. Sublime bacon as a side dish; also prone to putting kimchi on their meats to good effect.

The Table, San Jose: New American. Amazing coffee, constantly rotating menu with slight Asian influence.

 

Best Breakfast Elsewhere :slight_smile: 
Shady Maples Smorgasbord: Amish breakfast, lunch, dinner. Really awesome!

​
Lucid unveiled the Dream variant of its upcoming Air electric sedan at an event today for a couple hundred people who have already put down deposits. Note: Photos with this story are not the production model; we were not allowed to photograph that.
The automaker's intention is to compete with German luxury brands.
Lucid says the car has already achieved more than 400 miles of range on a single charge in real-world testing.
Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson places a carry-on bag on the stage at the company's new showroom and headquarters in Newark, California. He pops it open and pulls out the Lucid Air's motor, transmission, and inverter as one single piece. It's a bit of showmanship for the automotive startup, but it's also an illustration of the engineer turned boss's plan to make the mechanics of the company smaller and more efficient while exuding an air (get it?) of luxury.

Ahead of the unveiling of the production-model Air, Lucid gave approximately 250 deposit holders a first look at the electric sedan ahead of the rest of the world. Red stickers were placed over the smartphone lenses of those in attendance, as photos were prohibited. But what was shown is nearly identical to the beta vehicles Lucid has been showing off—albeit shinier and with a proper interior.

The carry-on powertrain weighs all of 160 pounds but is expected to have an output of 600 horsepower and 2950 lb-ft of torque, Lucid claims. The all-wheel-drive Air will get two of them shoved into the automaker's skateboard platform.




​Between the motors will sit a 110.0-kWh battery pack that the company says will provide a range of more than 400 miles. On stage, Rawlinson told the audience that Lucid personnel drove one of their beta vehicles from Newark in Northern California to the Santa Monica Pier via the Pacific Coast Highway—a distance Google Maps gives as 411 miles—without stopping to charge, and with range to spare.

That's an impressive claim from a 110.0-kWh battery pack connected to a charger that supports two-way power. In addition to charging at up 300 kW, the car can also power the house it's plugged into, Lucid claims.

This shows, among other things, CEO Rawlinson's obsession with efficiency and miniaturization. During a post-presentation interview he said: ""I don't measure an electric-car company's progress by its battery size. Conversely, I wish we could have a smaller battery. Let's look at range efficiency with the smallest possible battery. That's the metric that really counts.""

To that end, the company originally said, back in 2016, that its 400-plus-mile range target would require a 130.0-kWh pack. Now it's down to 110.0 kWh for the production model. A smaller battery means less weight and a lower cost. Rawlinson said that his vision over the next few years is to get to five miles per kilowatt-hour, which would be a feat. Consider that Tesla just boasted that its upcoming Model Y will be its more efficient vehicle at 4.1 miles per kilowatt-hour.

All that is wrapped in a vehicle that's meant to compete with luxury sedans from Germany.

The interior, as C/D saw it today, displays the luxury that Lucid is going for. It's modern minimalism with high-quality materials throughout. Nappa leather adorns the seats, and sheep or alpaca wool weaves accent the doors and dash, along with the obligatory Alcantara.

Lucid is offering five different interior color schemes all based on California locations: Santa Monica, Big Basin, Santa Cruz, Mojave, and Tahoe. Each is a variant meant to represent the region, and they include earth tones but also a lot of white, black, and beige.

The automaker has decided not to participate in the battle for the largest screens. Instead, the displays in the car look more subdued. Most of the controls are behind glass. To the left of the digital dash cluster, a small touchscreen houses secondary features such as windshield-wiper controls. A display on the dash houses the infotainment system, and a third screen in the center console is where the climate controls are fine-tuned.

The weirdest feature we spotted is that the center console display will retract into the dash, unveiling a storage area. Sadly, it was not demoed at the event.


Happy Customers, for Now

The attendees crowded around the vehicle as it rolled into the showroom. They seemed happy that they had put up the cash to be one of the first to take delivery of the EV from the new automaker. Production is expected to start by the end of the year at the company's factory, currently being built in Arizona. We were shown video of the steel skeleton near completion.

Lucid is headquartered in Northern California, where CEOs take every opportunity to share with the world their excitement about changing the world. Rawlinson does believe his company and its tech can help make the planet a greener place, but he's not ready to declare victory about what the company just rolled out to future owners.

""I feel until we get into production we haven't changed anything,"" he told Car and Driver. ""I'm eternally optimistic. But I'm grounded in realism. Ultimately, I'm neutral.""

Rawlinson asserted that the company has ""fantastic technology"" but that many people don't believe it's real. Rawlinson was the head engineer on the Tesla Model S, so he knows a little something about working on a product that the world doesn't believe is possible or will even make it to market.

Naysayers have a point: A lot can go wrong while building a factory. A construction delay could push the Lucid Air production timeline back, which could result in burning through more money and potential lost revenue from early adopters who might decide to drop their reservation and buy something else.

But Rawlinson and his team express confidence that their luxury EV sedan will fill an unfulfilled space in the automotive market: both fancy and efficient. In their minds, it'll be something for the Model S owner who wants a bit more luxury or the S-class owner who wants something different and more eco-friendly.

The Lucid Air's powerplant is supposed to propel the vehicle from zero to 60 mph in under 2.5 seconds. But it’s up to the company to move just as quickly to make that a reality.

It was only the ""Long Range"" version of the Model S that attained the 402-mile rating recently. However, assuming the Lucid the EPA tested was the twin-motor version, its performance is more in line with the ""Performance"" version of the Model S, which still has an EPA rating of 348 miles.

At the same time, the Tesla has a 100-kWh battery pack, and I'm assuming the Lucid has the 110-kWh pack that was reportedly used in the highway range tests earlier this year. So, given the different battery capacities, the better comparison of the Tesla to the Lucid is not actual range, but the efficiency metric of miles/kWh. Using that metric, the Lucid is yielding just over 4 miles/kWh in EPA testing, while the Tesla Performance Model S is yielding 3.48 miles/kWh . . . i. e., 15% better efficiency.

If so, this is a significant accomplishment for Lucid and, on top of the recent Cd test results, further support for the proposition that Lucid actually fulfills its claims about the car. I'm keeping my eyes peeled for the Tuesday announcement to see if they clarify the configuration of the car tested, such as battery pack size, number of motors, tire and wheel combos, etc.",2020-08-08,8.0,154.0,,

I might also add a few points here to consider...


Interior Space - the space is incredible and simply non-comparable to Tesla. The back seat is so spacious and luxurious (without being stuffy as you mentioned) that my family joking fights over who gets to sit in the back. They call it ""First Class"" back there.
The Lucid marries performance, efficiency, and comfort in a way I've not seen in any other vehicle. 0-60 like a race car, Rated 425 - 516 Range depending on trim which is unmatched, and first class comfort for all passengers not just the driver.
Fast charging - the Lucid can charge at extremely high throughput and has a Home Charger that can deliver top notch Level 2 charging speeds (80amps delivered)
I put in my reservation in 2021 after test driving a Tesla, which I was dead set on buying - prior to the test drive. I wanted something beyond an iPad for UI, and more space and range. Back when I ordered, I couldn't even test drive as there were no vehicles to do so. To your point, when I did test drive, a year later and two weeks prior to delivery, I was blown away. In my mind I was buying the longest range and purpose build UI as you mentioned EV. I literally had no idea how advanced this vehicle was, and couldn't believe how awesome it felt to drive! I've had mine since 12/31/2022 and everyday I find something else about this Lucid that impresses me more. 

Continue to take your own advice and test drive more, and get more familiar with the vehicle. You'll have a hard time stopping thinking about it.

Personally, I view EPA ratings as next to useless.

The rubber really only meets the road in real-world testing done by journalistic organizations such as Edmunds, Out of Spec Motoring, State of Charge, etc.

And, just as Edmunds found in this report, the longest range any of these independent testers have ever realized in real-world conditions are with Lucids. In fact, even with the questions raised by this report, the possibly-faulty car Edmunds tested still ranked second out of fifty EVs they've tested, with first place held by another Lucid.

Among the large EV luxury sedans, Edmunds got 505 miles from Lucid's longest-range car (an Air Dream Range) compared to 422 miles from MB's longest-range electric (an EQS 450+) with a single motor and far less power. Both Tesla's longest-range car (a Model 3 Long Range) and its large sedan (a Model S Plaid) realized only 345 miles of range with Edmunds.

In trying to market against Tesla's hyped-up range claims derived from 5-cycle EPA testing, Lucid laid a trap for itself with uninitiated EV buyers who take EPA ratings too literally.

If you want the most range you can get when taking an EV on a long road trip in which you drive it as you would an ICE car (i. e., not bothering with attempts at hyper-miling), get a Lucid.

If you want an EV that will deliver its (much lower) EPA range on that same trip, get a Porsche Taycan. You'll have to charge a lot more often, but at least you'll meet that EPA rating.",2023-03-10,8.0,154.0,,

I love EVs but have never been a crazy car person before. This car has made me a crazy car person. It is meant to be driven and gives joy when doing so. I freaking love it, to the point that my family thinks I'm bonkers. We've been on 2 trips overseas and I've tried to schedule picking up my car on the way home from the airport - that is how much I want to drive it. Sadly, Christopher has thwarted me each time by bringing my car home and parking it in my garage for me before I get home. The nerve!  

I've had a couple small issues - the frunk had some opening issues off the bat, but they kept at it until it was fixed. They also replaced my creaky steering wheel at the same time. I got a ""front left light malfunction"" error every once in a while (light still worked), so they checked the wiring on that when I was gone and it hasn't been back since. I've had zero issuss that affect my daily driving or have stranded me anywhere - even for a short period of time. Hopefully this post will not jinx that. Service themselves have been stellar and always responsive.

For me, I don't understand all these software complaints. Maybe because I lived through Windows 95? I have a 2013 Model S and the software issues I lived with for years on that jalopy make the Lucid seem almost bug free (and thankfully it doesn't blast hot air at you). The music does pop on its own, but I live and drive through many dead spots, so I live with it by turning the volume down.

I have had 1 EA issue with it charging super slow, though that could be on EA. The fob batteries died often in the beginning, but that has been fixed. I like the Nav system - it was the only thing I was worried about before I got my car and it has been fine. Live traffic has a bit of a lag, but time to arrive is usually spot on.

Efficiency is great. My lifetime average in my Model S is 2.1. In this car it is 4.0. Sadly, colder weather has brought my current numbers to the high 3s, but it doesn't matter. I jump in the car and don't think about how many miles I have left. I've only worried once when I had forgotten to charge and had only 150 miles on the car and had to drive 4 kids over the mountains on a 100 mi round trip to a volleyball game, but even then I needn't have worried.

As an EV lover, it gives you all the satisfaction of an EV (fast, powerful, fun) in a beautiful and extremely comfortable package. I don't worry about the future of the company or the stock price. I wonder when I'm going on my next drive.",2022-12-15,8.0,,Air GT,100.0

64,General Discussions,Lucid Air To Hit California Streets With Its 400+ Mile Range,https://lucidowners.com/threads/lucid-air-to-hit-california-streets-with-its-400-mile-range.13/,Joe,Staff Member,False,2017-07-19,308,Texas,,"Lucid Motors has been cleared by the state of California to allow them to begin road-testing of their first offering, the Lucid Air electric sedan. This marks another milestone for the company, as until now, they were limited to testing out their pre-production test vehicles on private property. 

The company has been using Auto Club Speedway, in Fontana, California as their primary testing facility for driving-related testing. But as of this week, they will be allowed to take it to the streets.





​After a couple of years of delays, Lucid received the financing they needed, and the Air is scheduled to begin production in the 4th quarter of 2020. We're pleased to hear that Lucid isn't backing down from their initial claims of more than 400 miles of range (EPA-rated range, that is) and also the 900-volt battery system. In fact, we're now getting what appears to be official confirmation on it.

If Lucid delivers on the promise of a 400+ mile range EV, they may be the first manufacturer to crack the 400-mile mark. Elon Musk recently promised a 400-mile Model S, but gave no timeline as to when that will happen. Therefore, if Lucid does begin selling the Air before the end of this year, and Tesla doesn't update the Model S before then Lucid will indeed, be the first to 400.

We were actually reminded of those facts by a recent tweet from BloomberyNEF's Head of Energy Storage, James Frith when he tweeted:




​Also, according to Electrek, Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson, said that their vehicle is more efficient because of the 900-volt battery system:

So the 900-volt battery system looks to indeed be making it to the production Lucid Air. With all of the delays and financial issues Lucid had over the past few years, we weren't sure if they had decided to alter the battery system in an effort to speed up their engineering processes and reduce costs, that evidently didn't happen.

A 900-volt system will also allow Lucid to offer very high DC fast charging rates like Porsche did with the Taycan's 800-volt battery, as the Taycan can charge up to 270 kW. It's possible that the Air may be able to charge at over 300 kW. Some Electrify America stations can deliver up to 350 kW, so the power is there if the Air can take it. 

The production version of the Air will be introduced at the New York Auto show and is expected to retain much of the concept's appearance and features. Lucid Motors is planning a press event in about a month and InsideEVs had already been invited, so we'll have more information on the electric startup soon. Let us know what questions you'd like answered when we visit their headquarters next month, and we'll try to get the answers.

Been driving Teslas for 8 years and have purchased 3. First was a P85D which I traded in 6 years ago for an X. I still own it today and along the way, we traded my wife’s Lexus for a Model 3 Performance. Had discarded Lucid as a future option first time I heard of it. Look didn’t catch my eye and I was frankly overall happy with Tesla driving dynamics.

A few weeks ago, I was in Vancouver on a business trip and a colleague mentioned he had stopped by the Lucid Studio and was quite impressed. Didn’t think we had a studio here in Montreal so wanted to drop by as well but ran out of time. Flew back home and the thought of needing to take a second look at Lucid lingered.

Checked out the web site and realized it’s 500+ miles of range? What? (I know, their claim to fame but to my defence I just skipped Lucid news as I had discarded it as an option for me.) Watched quite a bit of YouTube and the look grew on me. And of course, it confirmed my Tesla interiors were a let down. I then searched to see when Lucid would open a studio here and surprise, they just did!

So, I booked a test drive. Was quite impressed. Went in a second time to take another look at the car. At that point, they kindly offered me to do another, longer test drive. I thought I’d share my impressions and how they align with I had read and heard before getting behind the wheels of one.

-OUTSIDE: This car looks much better in person. Photos and videos don’t do it justice. I first discounted the nose/grill as odd online but it’s not at all. It’s probably the most successful front end since cars no longer require air flow there. Car’s got presence and a unique look IMO.

-INSIDE: Probably the part I love the most. It’s classy but not stuffy. Feels like a modern take on luxury cars. Tried the EQS right after the Air and while it‘s got a gorgeous, plush inside, it felt older.

-SCREENS: After all the negative comments, I was expecting bad UI ergonomics and sluggish response. I imagine the bulk of these comments came mostly from early firmware iterations because my feeling is different. Sure Tesla offers more options on its screens but their experience is more akin to using an iPad. Do anything you want. I feel like Lucid’s UI is simpler and more purpose built. Less stuff fights for your attention or gets in the way. And the screens feel more seamlessly integrated into their environment.

-COLORS: No good or bad answer here. It’s personal of course. Two tone was another turn off for me initially. Now that I’ve seen a few vehicles, I find the two tone looks really good on light bodied cars or on dark bodied cars with the stealth option. As for interior colors, I love them all. Been going back and forth non stop on what I’d pick.

-DRIVING: So I drove an Air GT Range twice. Less bouncy than my X, not as harsh as my 3 obviously but also the S (both my old P85D and the Raven model I recently test drove). So the ride seems like a good balance of sport and road comfort. The acceleration felt stronger than the non performance Teslas although the 0-60 is roughly the same. It had a more of an initial kick, which I like. Is it because the rear motors are more powerful? Either way, quite pleasant. 

I was debating upgrading my X to an S or the EQS. The EQS is now out of the running for looks and range. It’s now been replaced by the Air, which is at the top of my list.

Will continue mulling it over the next few days but thanks to all on this forum. The information is quite helpful to make a decision.",2023-02-19,7.5,,,

I can't really say, as I've never wanted to go without a break when driving the distance it would take to exhaust a full Dream Edition battery.

What I do know is that on our road trips we consistently drive around 80mph or a bit over with occasional higher bursts to get away from traffic clumps. We keep the A/C set to 70 degrees on hot days and run the audio system at decent volume. We start looking to combine a break with a charging stop around the 3-hour mark. And we have never used more that 67% of the battery charge in these conditions.

After owning this beautiful vehicle 6 months we’ve driven her over 20k miles and it’s been wonderful. It still looks new inside/out and have had no real issues whatsoever. Really the only annoying thing is the Bluetooth connectivity when locking/unlocking sometimes but is not an issue if I have the key fob. We travel a lot mainly for work and to see family. It gets charged to 100% a lot, which we used to do in the Tesla for road trips as well. I’m not worried at all. I’ve always driven every vehicle I’ve ever owned hard. I hand wash it every week, keep the air in the tires good and mostly charge at home. Our trips are usually 300-415 miles round trip so no DC fast charging needed. The range is fairly accurate but one does have to account for certain driving behaviors, terrain and weather conditions. I’m guessing when driving long distances in our situation which is in Florida, 70degrees with a Grand Touring on 19” wheels in smooth going the speed limit we’ll lose from 60-95 miles from the total trip. I cut it close once and made it home with 10 miles left. Our lifetime average is 3.7kwh but have seen 4-4.2 driving around town. Range is king and was the main reason for buying this car. This is also why we opted for the 19” wheels. You lose a huge amount of range with the 21”s. So if getting a Touring for example with the estimated 425EPA range it’s actually somewhere around 340-350 then on top of that you lose about 55 more miles from having the 21”s so now you’re at 290ish. And that’s with flat terrain in good weather. That’s a huge hit. The tires still look new and there’s no visible inner or outer tire ware that I can see. No rattles whatsoever and I believe the software issues are way over blown. When compared to our model 3 it’s really not a huge difference in my opinion. I actually really like the dreamdrive pro better than FSD. The main reason is there is no Phantom braking on the Lucid. That really kills it for me on the Tesla. Over all it’s been a fabulous vehicle and I’ll keep everybody updated on any maintenance issues that we come across. Cheers!",2023-02-19,7.5,0.0,Air GT,100.0

I hope that some of your hesitation can recede as Lucid sorts out the software bug-a-boos which make up the vast majority of the issues owners are having.

As an owner who has had a few more early issues that most others, I can assure you I see them as minor in the scheme of things. For one thing, there have been far fewer hardware/build issues than with the Tesla Model S Plaid we bought in August. And they were resolved quickly and satisfactorily by Lucid service.

The software glitches continue, but I am seeing improvement with each update and am comfortable things will stay on this trajectory.

But, software issues and a couple of hardware fixes aside, at this point I am convinced I am driving the best car I've ever owned -- and I've owned my share of big-ticket luxury and performance cars.",2022-02-21,7.5,154.0,,

We left the charging station in Anthem and due to posted speeds and traffic, we set the HWA at 70mph. The Temperature was 69 and for just over 100 miles, we logged 4.4 miles/KWh. (This is the number that will give the approximate 512 mile range) After merging on I-8 and setting the HWA at 75, the Miles/kWh stabilized at 4.0 (temperature still at 69) until we climbed the Chocolate Mountains just outside of Yuma….the Miles/KWh dropped to 3.8. We charged a bit in Yuma while stretching an walking, had a latte at Starbucks and then drove from below sea level to over 4,000’ to get back home in San Diego County…the miles/kWh dropped to 3.2. My observation is that the sweet spot for EPA class mileage is a temperature of 69 and a speed of 70, driving with very even inputs for steering, braking and acceleration helps.
Again, I am glad that with much lower temperatures steep topography and faster speeds, the battery’s size allows very a respectable range. I like to have the % showing on the dash rather than the miles remaining(% is an option) and I like to open on the Pilot Panel the “Vehicle” on the settings, and the Trip option on the Vehicle heading. The first line shows the current mileage since last charge and the running “Miles/KWh”. Much easier to estimate remaining miles with % and miles/KWh.

If you've hit 10K or more, please let the forum know about the good and the bad, including mechanical and software issues, efficiency, and what you like and dislike about the car. 

Fair warning: Everything has gone well so far, so this review will be boring.

I received my Lucid at the beginning of May 2022 and just last week passed the 10K mark. Driving has generally been long-distance in the Northeast because (1) the car is a great highway cruiser (My wife calls it my Cadillac. She's not wrong.) and (2) I find excuses to drive it long distances because it's fun.

The car has had a few minor issues but nothing that couldn't be corrected by a tech in my driveway. This included soft close doors that needed to be readjusted, loose weatherstripping around the trunk and wheels, a small puncture in the backseat leather, and... hmm... that's about it. The alignment of the trunk and the rear seems off, so that bugs me every time I think of it, which is generally never. Otherwise, no mechanical issues, no drivetrain issues, no turtle of doom, etc. It's been rock solid.

I've had trouble at one EA charger and found others to be painfully slow, but otherwise it's been good. Then again, I use PlugShare and ABRP when planning out drives, as I have charger anxiety more than range anxiety.

The software sucked until V2.0. Then it sucked less. V2.0 is what Lucid should have launched with but at least it's here now and slowly getting better. No issues with installs of any software until today when my V2.0.36 software read V2.0.35 and the sound cut out until I reset the car. Took 5 minutes.

At 10K miles, I'm averaging 3.4 mi/kWH, which is nowhere near the EPA figure of 4.6. That would be seriously disappointing except that I drive like a possessed idiot and will find any excuse to hit triple digits. (That truck is weaving from side to side! For safety's sake, I must pass it at 100 MPH!) If I wanted 4.6 mi/kWH, I'd have to drive at 55 mph, which is not okay.

The driving experience has been so exceptional that I actually missed driving the Lucid when I was out of town this past week. I'm mainly taking the car out on long drives, and it's the only car that I don't get exhausted driving. I think it's due to an absence of noise and to a decent though not perfect first version of highway assist. Plus, being able to gun it at will keeps the drive fun. The car just makes me smile. Also, the lighting system is ridiculously cool.

So, what do I not like about it so far? Software bugs (like Tidal starting up at random or random sound dropouts). The GPS nav is nowhere near as good as Google Maps. (I miss Apple Car Play.) Alexa is useless. Sirius XM sounds atrocious. Consistent unlocking still seems hit or miss but at least it's faster at being hit or miss. Design-wise, the ground clearance is less than I expected, so that'll be interesting when winter really sets in. I think the backseat space is almost too big and could have been better designed to be special rather than just cavernous. I also hate the center console. Aside from the nice sliding wood, it feels cheap. And the single wireless charger is needlessly small, but hey, at least it matches the size of the miniaturized cupholders. And the USB ports not being data-enabled is simply weird. Who does that? 

But the Lucid is a car and not an entertainment device. And as a car, it's an amazing achievement: Efficient enough not to worry about electrons. Stupidly, stupidly fast but not just straight line fast (Did I mention it's fast?) but fun to toss around curves and to launch up hills like a portable private roller coaster. (My buddy thinks the Lucid is more like flying than driving, so he's always asking me how my flight was.) It's spacious inside with plenty of room for cargo, including a usable frunk that easily holds a 22# spatchcocked turkey. And a trunk that easily holds two bodies. (Whoops! TMI...) Plus, my dog really likes it. That backseat is her domain.

So, yeah, it's been great so far. I hope that this continues and I don't get visited by the Turtle of Doom as a comeuppance for being enthusiastic about the car. And I hope the company survives production and delivery hell so that I can continue to get service & swag. (I have three Lucid water bottles so far. Which is great, as they're the only things that fit in the cupholders.)",2022-12-14,7.5,,Air GT,100.0

We have an early-production Dream Edition (No. 154) nearing 12,000 miles on the odometer. I would say everything about the car that Dortreao said in the above quote.

We also have a Tesla Model S Plaid that we got four months before the Lucid. In terms of size, power, and vehicle category (sedan), it is the car to which the Lucid is best compared. (It's also notable that the original versions of both cars were the engineering children -- born a decade apart -- of the same man: Peter Rawlinson.) By every key point of comparison other than 0-60 times, the Air simply blows the Tesla away: handling precision, roadway stability, structural rigidity, ride compliance, interior noise, passenger room, luxury features, assembly quality. Even the Lucid's blazing 0-60 times are more accessible than the Plaid's earth-shattering times, as the Lucid stays much better planted under deep-throttle blasts. (Full-throttle blasts in either car are not something I would recommend other than on a drag strip.)

Once we got the Lucid, it became the default car any time there was going to be more than two people in the car by dint of its much more capacious rear seat. For the first couple of months, any trip with the two of us was preceded by a brief discussion about which car to take. I preferred the Air, but my partner still liked driving the Tesla, so we chose which car to take depending on who was going to drive. But soon enough, those discussions fell by the wayside. If my partner is going somewhere by himself, he still usually takes the Tesla, which has sort of become ""his"" car. If we're both going, though, we just automatically head for the Air, even if he's driving. It took him a while, but he's finally admitted the Air is the better car all around. (It doesn't help that the Tesla has developed some body squeaks and groans while the Air has stayed solid as a bank vault.)

Right now, it seems Lucid will become our household go-to brand, with plans to replace our Honda Odyssey minivan with the Lucid Gravity in another year or two.

The only dark spot on the horizon right now is the worry that Lucid's service infrastructure is becoming overwhelmed. Where once a call to the nearest Service Center got someone in that Center on the line -- and a very quick repair response -- these days a call to a regional Service Center takes you through several IVR menus, with the call being redirected to the central Customer Service team in California. Once there, you wait on hold for 5-15 minutes for someone to pick up the call. Then, if you need to talk to the regional Service Center, they tell you they will have someone call you back. That callback can take a half day or more, if it comes at all.

I'm particularly annoyed about this right now. I got a letter saying my nearest Service Center was now prepared to begin the tow hook recall work and that I should call to arrange a pick up. I do so, and the car was picked up on November 29. Today is December 16, and the car is still there. As were are planning to leave on a road trip on December 19, I've been getting antsier by the day -- and every attempt to get a status report on the car becomes a full-day effort actually to get someone on the phone. I even had to contact Zak Edson, the VP of Sales & Service, to get a direct phone number for someone who could actually find out the status of the work.

After everything I've said about the Tesla Plaid, it seems that may be the car we have to take on this trip. So I'm a bit pissed at Lucid right now.",2022-12-16,7.5,154.0,,

If I must summarize my experience so far in one sentence, then it shall be: “I love my Air Dream!!”. If I need to elaborate a bit more, then:

Pro:

Driving Dynamics: Silky smooth, whether it’s 15mph in the parking lot, or triple-digits on the I-5, at any speed, I always feel in control, firmly rooted, solid and composed. and at any speed, I can step on the accelerator and have it punch up another 15mph without hesitation. The steering is precise and predictable, the corning is confident. The car glides on highway, hard to explain the feeling.
Sound Immersion: I don’t care about XM, and I have had a hard time finding Atmos tracks I liked in Tidal, I am all Spotify. The weekly updated playlist is what I listen to the most. When I am alone, I turn up the volume, and lose myself in the music, I really don’t know a better way to calm myself than the stereo system of Air. The music surrounds me, rich base, and crisp vocal.
The Looks: after about 16,000 miles, I still find myself doing double-take of the car as I depart from it. And even after a year, people still gawking at the Air at stoplights, and approach me to ask about the car.
Range: never had range anxiety, 20 mins at EA, all good to go! Over the past ~16,000 miles, I average 2.8mi/kWh, and did I mention I frequently do triple-digits spirited driving?
Quietness: no rattle, no squeaking (after the steering wheel replacement, see Cons below), I have a thing against noise, drives me nuts, and the Air delivers. The electric motor whining sound, I actually like it, a bit of “engine” feedback, I don’t mind it.

Con:

The 1.x firmware was rough, waiting 10-30 secs for the car to boot, NAV / music switching lag. 2.x firmware fixed all that. Can’t believe I tolerated the 1.x for 10 months!
NAV even after 2.x firmware is still mediocre, love the color scheme of the map, but really wish Lucid would use Google map. Turn-by-turn directions is always bit late. And after 2.x update, my NAV got stuck somewhere off the coast of Ghana once, self-healed, then got stuck in Lucid HQ, self-healed again, and stuck at HQ again. Still stuck even today. Need to go to the service and have the module rebooted.
NAV not working is a nuisance, but it also disabled the Highway Assist (no GPS fencing, the hwy assist won’t turn on), and it won’t pop up the screen for me to open my garage when I approach home. Very inconvenient.
Build Quality: over the 11 months of ownership, I have had the trunk lid gasket replaced twice, steering wheel replaced due to the Rice-Krispies-snap-crackle-pop sound when I apply pressure on the wheel, Millbrae replaced the wheel, and now it is solid, LOVE IT!!
Wind Noise: I did notice a bit of wind noise in the front wind-shield, short of a low frequency whistling sound when I go above 80mph. Tried to have the service look at it, but the SA are not allowed to drive above 65mph, haha, so I will live with it.

Bottomline:

Still wish Lucid can utilize the Pilot screen more, make it independent, fully utilize the screen’s real estate.
Don’t care about Apple CarPlay
I wish the mobile key is more reliable, it seems to misbehave after every firmware update.
Wishing for Audible native app
Wishing for customize all-weather doormat, my white original doormat is holding up fairly well, but all the rain is tearing me apart.
The after-sale service is top-notch. Sure, they are getting more busy as more Lucid are being delivered, but every interaction with the Service Advisor has been pleasant.
I travel a lot, at least a week in a month, I miss the Air when I am away. Whenever I return from my trip, I always find some excuse to take the Air out for “errand”, getting not-so-needed toothpaste, or get it not-so-needed charge at EA.
All my other cars, Range Rover, Escalade, BMW & S-Class are collecting dust. The S-Class is having its batteries changed tomorrow due to the lack of driving.
The Highway Assist is nice, but I really don’t care about it neither. Such a driver car, I find no need to have the computer drive it for me.

Whichever third party company they use for the GPS data needs to verify some one-way streets. I was also sent 22 minutes out of the way to a destination. I fault the data and third party, not Lucid on this.

Its a driver's car, so please add:

USB wired connection, car has no satellite so I should be able to use my own hardwired music player.

When watching a company, one of the sources I use is GlassDoor, a site where employees (current and ex) post about their employers. Such sites tend to be outlets for the disgruntled, but viable insight can be gleaned from the trends of the posts, if not from some of the individual posts.

Seen through the GlassDoor lens, Rawlinson appears as a driven task master, putting in and expecting long hours and unstinting dedication to mission from everyone. He sets high engineering goals and is relentless in pursuing them, sometimes being openly abusive to subordinates in public settings.

The overall tenor of the posts, including from those who departed hating Rawlinson and/or the company, is that:

- Rawlinson, though he can be an unpleasant human being, is a brilliant engineer

- the heads of the technical divisions are top drawer in their fields, even if other functional heads might not be

- the competence and dedication of the workforce in general is very high

- the car itself is an amazing product.

For those of you who don't know me, I have been pretty active on the forums, been reserved for a Touring reservation since March of 2021

Meticulously searching and reading everything I could on Lucid, and awaiting my delivery.


I got lucky and found 2 AGT's for around $119k online, one happened to pop up right after the other, and the latter had the exact specs I wanted, color, interior combination choice, 19"" tires, etc...

Talk about a stroke of luck?


I picked it up in DC and drove it back to Utah, about 2000+ miles.

I will outline the goods and the bads during my trip as well as problems/bugs along the way.


First thing I noticed when I was shown the car was that it was absolutely beautiful, I loved the Zenith Red with the Tahoe interior, it was my favorite choice and I am really glad I went with it. It changes color in the night and looks black from afar. The tri-color finish is complicated, but marvelous to look at.
From my test drive, I drove the exact same one, so things were very familiar.

The previous owner had put the black lug nuts on the wheels which is great because that's something I would've done. He also had the matching carpet 3rd party carpets, all weather honeycomb mats. They were also great.

We did our first charge in Virginia where plug and play worked immediately. I was able to hit 170 KW in charging and about 25 minutes later, I was at 85% and we went on our way. For the record, I never went above 85% during the whole road trip, just care too much about keeping the battery flawless, and I was find with making multiple stops along the way and truly enjoying the car.
So far charging experience was 10/10, I hit 17/18 chargers where plug and play worked, only the final charger in my own hometown didn't work because it needed to be initiated from the app.
However I was told by a Lucid rep who has used the same chargers that the 3rd station works on plug and play and the first didn't. So maybe I just needed to try another charger.

The drive was very smooth, I am used to Utah roads and so 75-80 mph is my norm.
I had it on highway assist about 80% of the time and it was a very smooth, centered, and delightful ride.

Road noise was very low, compared to my other cars I've driven, it's on another level, I've never been at 80+ MPH and had such a quiet cabin.
I know people complain about not having a hatchback and them going with this clamshell design, and also the inner door wells being so low (some people bump their heads a lot when getting in and out). But I don't mind because these design decisions is what's making it possible to have such a quiet interior experience.

No creaks or noises in the cabin, I am satisfied with all materials alcantara, leather, wood, and other materials used in the car. Sometimes I just sit there touching them.

I did notice though that when I was driving in 15 degrees weather, my knees would sometimes get cold, I think there's some air getting in through the cracks, but I wasn't able to quite pinpoint where.

As for the climate settings, my auto doesn't quite work, I have it set at 86 F but it failed to keep the cabin temperature warm. I would have to disable auto and manually put the fans on 4 or 5 on warm settings in order to really keep the cabin warm when it's 20 or below outside. On normal circumstances, auto works totally fine.

I also thought that Lucid had auto defrosters (some cars will automatically turn on defrosters when the windshield starts to fog up) but I didn't notice them.
I found out through these forums that the front camera and possibly the LIDAR has a defrosting strip that runs across it and so I will add that to my list of tools on my next drive.
Winter driving was a bit rough because in snow storms, the cameras and lidar would get covered constantly. Every half hour to an hour I would have to get out and wipe the cameras for highway assist to work.

I do find the ADAS system a little extreme, I haven't messed with the settings much because I do like to keep the annoying features in just in-case who knows when it might save me.
But at the same time, when lanes are fading or when there's construction, it's tough sometimes to fight against the car to stay in lane when that lane is ending and you need to follow a cone path. Or when the lane has faded and new paint has been drawn for a new lane, but the car sees the old lane instead of the new one and will try to keep you on that path. So I would fight with the car occasionally during those situations.

The camera inside the car that watches your eye is very useful, and in-fact did give me the coffee symbol or break symbol once during the trip, and I was pretty tired and swerved around a bit, so it was spot on. Found the nearest Electrify America and took a power nap while it charged.
Also for future travelers, the seats are comfortable and honestly had no issues sleeping in the car while charging. But it would be smart to plan a stop near a level 2 charger or destination charger so that you can sleep peacefully while you charge as you won't get hit with idle fees like at Electrify America.

Further on the camera watching you, if you move your steering wheel all the way up, it impacts the camera and you won't get those notifications anymore, which I discovered by mistake. Or you can turn it off in dreamdrive settings. But I was moving my steering while quite a bit because I couldn't find a happy medium between being able to see the cockpit screen (highway assist, speed limit, etc..) and also having the camera watch my eyes. So I was going back and forth because on long road trips, I like to have my steering position at the lowest settings, I grab it from the bottom and just stay steady and res my arms on the sides.

On highway assist if it would tell me to keep my hands on the wheels, I would literally just jiggle it left and right for a quick second and then it would go away. So I didn't find that annoying or excessive at all. Sensitivity was nice.

During the trip itself, I was hitting every charger I could to get juice to 80% at least before continuing. But by the middle of the trip, I was so comfortable with Electrify America that I was skipping 2 chargers at a time and arriving at chargers at 10-15% percent because Plug and Play was just so good!!!

The massage seats and seat warmers are excellent, I used them quite often. The seat warmers get extremely hot and I was on 1 or 2 settings most of the time. Heated steering wheel was really clutch during the 15 degree weather.

I was in Ohio and it was 15 degrees outside and I think that's where my frunk was having problems because it would not open, and after a while it did open but then wouldn't close properly (it wouldn't latch unless I put my hand on top), and since that time is where I had frunk issues. Lucid probably tested all different types of weather, but I wonder how cold they really went? But I prefer to use the trunk in cold weather rather than the frunk now.

Auto High beam was awesome and made one less thing I had to worry about.
I didn't notice the lights turning in the direction of my steering a lot, when you make a 90 degree turn, as you turn the wheels I remember reading in the owner's manually that the headlights will follow the wheel or where you're looking to go.
I didn't notice it that much to be honest, maybe my conditions weren't optimal.

The camera was a little weird, so the front facing camera is in the middle of the 2 chrome lips of the Lucid, but having the camera overlook from on top of the bottom lip makes it so that you can't accurate see the ground. The car will tell you that you are 5 inches away from a curb, in reality, you probably have another 5 inches or so. I noticed myself parking way further back than I thought I was. If youy put on Surround view, and look from the top, and turn your wheels all the way to the left or right, then you can kind of see the wheels. and it's a bit off from where the front camera thinks you are.

I am going to go into an empty parking lot and use some cones to dial in my front camera and learn to get better at reading the data.

The back leg room was phenomenal, it's crazy how much space is back there even when the driver and passenger is sitting comfortably.

I also noticed the driver seat reclines WAY more than the passenger seat. Not sure why that's the case?

One other thing that REALLY bothered me is that Lucid doesn't have an entry and exit mode on the car, I manually move my seat back every time I exit or enter the car, and noticed even the previous owner had a profile called 'exit' which had settings like steering wheel retraction, and seat moving back, etc... so he can get out of the car. And I'm not a tall person either.

The sun visor really bothered me. I don't know why they didn't just do it like the Model X and put it mounted to the side and when you wanted it put it up front, but having that suction cup thing is just weird and doesn't suit the full glass view you have. It seems like an obstruction, not sure. But I move it over 80% of the time as the first thing I do when I get inside of the car.
The blue tinting they did to the roof and front of the windshield I think is excellent, could be a tad bit higher, but never felt like I needed sunglasses because I think it did an excellent job blocking the sun and making it very comfortable to drive in all weather conditions. But if you're really tall, I can totally see it being a problem as the tint would be directly in your line of sight and then it would just be very annoying.

The navigation was not that great, I was using A Better Route Planner, and Google maps as a precaution. But I noticed sometimes Lucid would take me on roundabout roads and adding distance to my trip, maybe it didn't account for traffic? But sometimes it wouldn't even be clear about turns or showing arrows on exactly where to turn in. It was also a bit finicky in terms of zooming in on the car closer, and sometimes it would be pretty far away. It made it very difficult in cities like Chicago where there was a lot of bridges, tunnels, and it would thing I was on the bottom floor and not on the bridge. I can see similar things happening in New York City.

I maintained 3.2 mi/kw throughout my trip, but my last leg from Colorado to Utah increased that to 3.5 as it was mostly downhill.
I also didn't realize that Park City is higher than Colorado at a height of 6000' and so part of that travel was flat to even a uphill climb. But when going to SLC, it was definitely downhill where I was chilling on the freeway regenning and everyone else had their brakes pressed the whole time.
Very satisfying and smooth journey downhill as I expected. No more downshifting herky jerky.

On my drive DC to Utah, I noticed some Rivians, Ford F-150 Lightnings, Ioniq 5's, and VW ID.4's, but coming into Utah, I saw Fiskers, Polestars, Ford E-transit vans, GMC Hummers, Porsche Taycans, Jaguar I-pace's, Mercedes EQS, Ford Mach-e, Rivians, and even the Lucid rep who was there said he'd never seen such a diversity of EV's in his life which I thought was pretty funny.

And I still have yet to see another Lucid on the road. weird.

As soon as I got back, I gave the car to the detailer who put PPF on the car and ceramic coating, he said don't wash it for a week and it's a bad winter here right now. So I am waiting until next week to wash it and post some real pictures. IN the meantime, some photos of the drive.",2022-12-03,5.0,,Air GT,100.0

And that's with zero attention being paid to efficiency. I'm doing 80-85 for most of that, since the speed limits around here are all 75. And actually, I get closer to 3.2 on highways. It's all the cruising around town that kills my range, really. I do a lot of short errand trips.

And that's more than fine for me. I know it will get better in the summer. And as I've said many times, other than occasional longer trips, I never have to think about charge, anyway. I start the day at 80 and end at whatever. I picked up a friend in Fort Collins the other day, which is an hour in each direction. I was going to check out the EA charger up there, just for the fun of it, but then I learned they don't have an EA charger in Fort Collins. It's down in Loveland, which was out of my way. So I didn't bother. Still got home with more than a hundred miles worth of range. (About 40 percent.)

However, they use the more-stringent 2-cycle EPA test instead of the more-forgiving 5-cycle test that Lucid and Tesla opt to use. Thus, Porsches and Audis start with very low EPA range estimates (just over 200 miles) that are easy to beat in highway driving. If Moloughey got 490 miles or above in the Lucid range test, it means that the Air almost doubled the Porsche highway range on a 118-kWh battery vs. the 92-kWh battery in the Porsche.

A 538-mile range from Moloughney against EPA estimates would be spectacular -- but anything in the upper 400's would be very good, indeed, especially if he did the test in his usual New Jersey venue in January.",2022-01-20,5.0,154.0,,

There's more range than my and my passengers' bladders can withstand on a long road trip, as I recently discovered. The number we see doesn't even accurately reflect the distance you can drive since range depends on many factors most of which deviate significantly from EPA rating.

With respect to numbers, in the design page for DEP when you select the information i it says 451 miles for the 21"" wheels and 471 for the 19"" wheels. See screen shot below. The 451 number is the one I expected since I have the 21"" wheels and the car was charged to 100% the night before I took delivery where it showed 450 miles.
On a recent road trip I charged to 100% and the range showed 445 miles. I am happy with that.

What I would really like to see, however, is MUCH more information about energy use, akin to the energy and trip consumption charts in Tesla vehicles. What matters most on a road trip is understanding how much energy is being used (not just the average mi/kWh) and the estimated energy capacity remaining at the destination. In the Lucid we don't get estimated percent at destination when we navigate to a destination. I hope this changes, along with improved charging information on route.

However, I have detailed my experience thus far below, but this is just one data point so take it with a grain of salt. 

My Touring has 20"" Aero lite wheels with the aero inserts left installed. After 2,500 miles of driving including an LA-SF and back trip, the lifetime efficiency number is 3.1mi/kwh. Given the 92kwh total battery pack capacity, the math says the real world range at that efficiency is 285miles. Charging only to 80% for daily driving the effective real world range becomes 228miles. When route planning I use 200miles as a comfortable number. 

I think the 20"" wheels do contribute to an efficiency penalty, but I also have a large grade in my daily commute which drags down the efficiency number as well. I remember seeing a post that said elevation gain has the largest impact on range and I have found that to be true. The grade I drive is ~4miles long, but the car consumes about 13miles of stated range to climb it. 

Perhaps a better way to estimate the ""idealized"" range penalty for the 20"" wheels is this: The new published range for the Touring is 425mi with 19"" wheels in EPA testing. To hit that number the efficiency value needed is 4.6mi/kwh and even on flat highway driving at 55mph on a 75F day, I haven't been able to achieve that. The best I have seen is 4.0. That would equate to 368mi of range which means the range penalty for the 20"" wheels compared to the 19"" wheels is ~57 ""ideal"" miles.",2022-12-14,5.0,,Air Touring,100.0

This is close to what I'm seeing. I have not yet seen a trip end -- whether local, mixed, or highway -- with better than a 3.4 m/kWh figure.

All of what @Dortreo said matches my experiences. 

Service:
Service visit 1: road force rebalance front right tire due to vibration above 35mph, solved problem. Visit 1A: two days after visit 1, spend 3 days investigating rear cabin water leak I either somehow caused myself or was caused by soft close door catching the seatbelt while closing during a massive rainstorm, no problem found.

Service visit 2: replace misaligned rocker panel trim that cracked, replace wheel well weather stripping, replace brake light cover that had warped, fixed left rear passenger control for window, reset navigation location. 

Scary events that didn’t need service:
-Reduced power mode at around 1K miles, resolved itself in 5 minutes after I repeatedly floored the accelerator, never had one problem with power since.
-Car rolled backwards on an incline when trying to drive forward, fixed by software OTA.

Charging events
-I cannot charge at any of the stalls at my local EA since mid October, which are crappy older ABB units that many other drivers have issues with. Every other location EA has either worked for me, or if it didn’t it didn’t work for other drivers. It authenticates but then quits charging after 2 seconds.

Unlike @Dortreo I’m actually pretty satisfied with the navigation and have used it without too much struggle on every road trip so far. I love the satellite view and using the large pilot panel to input destinations and view routes/add waypoints. I only use Alexa to say “Alexa play NPR news”, I’ve found that all voice recognition systems suck to the point where I turn green, my purple shorts rip and I smash things. 

As far as efficiency goes, I’m slightly less of a hooligan than @Dortreo but do pretend triple digits is the only safe speed at which to pass if the wife and kid aren’t in the car. If the wife and kid are in the car this bonkers laser guided missile of a car turns into an efficiency machine and I usually get 3.8 -4.0 mi/kwh under normal conditions. In winter (recent temps 20-30s), well sorry everyone I’m getting about 2.2 -2.4 mi/kwh. This car takes a big efficiency hit in cold temps. Oh well, don’t care, still love it, and would still pick it over any EV.

Software? See above. I’ve been lucky though, Tidal almost never has an issue for me lately. Like I can’t remember the last time it broke. Had total loss of audio once, cured by reboot. And yep, cup holders are too small and in the wrong place, USB charging cable spot is impossible to access. And that’s where my complaints end. For service this car has been more reliable than my prior car (Mercedes AMG a class) at a similar number of miles, and also more reliable than my wife’s Subaru which had a brake booster and master cylinder failure. It’s driver assist functions are better than any other car I’ve owned. Love the mirror cameras on the dash which have saved me from accidents, love the massage seats, love the heated seats, love the steering wheel, love the frunk/trunk. 

Here’s the key thing. I miss the car when I haven’t driven it in more than a couple days. It’s like a therapy session. After a bad day it calms me down, and after a good day it makes me want to have fun. And as @Dortreo already said, it’s the best thing I’ve ever drive for long drives. I’ve taken identical trips in other cars and got out feeling exhausted. With this car I get out feeling like I was just teleported and no time has passed. There’s something about this car that just removes the stress of exterior influences whether it’s traffic, weather, or whatever. I’ll even find myself purposefully taking LONGER routes to go where I’m going. I’m very much looking forward to whatever Lucid comes up with because this “starting point” as a car is already better than almost anything.",2022-12-15,5.0,,Air GT,90.0

Tesla and Lucid use the same one. BMW uses the other one. The BMW test is cheaper to perform, but generally gets worse results. So there’s a bit more of a fudge factor. Thus, folks often get better mileage than cars using that test suggest. Same is true for Mercedes, Porsche, and most of the others.

Tesla and Lucid get consistently lower results in the real world than their stated range. You can get those cars to make their mileage claims with some very careful conditions and driving styles. But most “normal” driving will net you lower results than the claim. But because the tests are identical, the amount lower should be roughly the same for both cars. 

So take the EPA, figure on 70-75%, and you are good to go. Unless you drive perfectly, in which case you will be pleasantly surprised. 

Even with the disparities between the tests, Tesla and Lucid will out range just about any other EV on the market in the real world.

The car averaged 2.9 miles/kWh for the trip. I consider that acceptable considering the ambient outdoor temperature was 38 degrees and we kept the cabin at about 67 degrees, also running the seat heaters. Speed was 72 mph with light wind, and no hills, with 95 percent highway driving. In any event, the Touring turned 1,000K during this journey and 1,100 be the time we returned home. Here are my one month, 1,000 mile impressions of my Touring: the good, the bad, but no ugly.

So far there have been no surprises. No creaks, squeaks, rattles, or other unseemly noises in my Zenith Red Touring with glass canopy. Just the gentle whine of the motors audible at slow speed, which is music to my ears after a lifetime of internal combustion noises. The Touring drives smoothly and quietly. It took awhile to be accustomed to one-pedal driving, but now I prefer it. The fit and finish of the car appears fine, although I am not as discerning as some of you. The charge port door is ever-so-slightly depressed when closed. The car has been pure pleasure with very few complaints. Considering its weight, it accelerates like a rocket in ""smooth"" mode while handling predictably and feels glued to the road. I haven't even tried the chiropractor modes. I had the front end PPF'd, filmed the glass canopy to make it darker and the entire car ceramic coated.

I didn't fully trust the ""highway assist"" mode, but gave it a chance on this drive. It worked reasonably well and did not bias toward the right edge of the lane. It did occasionally want to exit. I still prefer steering on my own with just the lane departure visual warning. I also noticed that if you keep your hand on the bottom of the steering wheel when in ""highway assist"" it does not detect your hand and flashes the warning to put your hands on the wheel.

My Touring has its quirks. I cannot get the radio to stay off. It starts playing every time I enter the car. I can mute it and follow the instruction manual's instructions for turning it off, but it keeps coming back on. This is ironic, since before retirement my career was a radio announcer. Yesterday, the turn signals stopped making any noise for the first ten minutes of my drive. After stopping and restarting, the normal indicator noise returned. Similarly, the 360-degree surround view was instantaneous until yesterday. Then it took about 30 seconds to load. Now it seems back to normal. 

After reading this forum for nine months I was a bit terrified of seeing that turtle appear on the cockpit panel, but again, so far, so good. 

As I previously posted, I am a bit annoyed about the time it takes to charge 60 percent at EA chargers. At home, the scheduled charging works flawlessly with my Grizzl-e charger. Lucid advertised with an asterisk something like ""20-minute charging from 20 to 80 percent.."" (I know someone will correct me if I misstated the numbers.) Obviously, this is not even close.

My SA and DA nudged me to upgrade from the Pure AWD to the Touring, and I'm very glad I did. Once you're in such rarefied realms of cost, another $10K doesn't make that much difference. The Touring has some extra creature comforts and I love the Tahoe interior decor. I really don't care much about the extra horsepower or glass canopy. 

I purchased my Touring the day after the $7,500 Lucid price rebate. Since I already had my cashier's check in hand for the original price and had no time to return to the bank, I signed the new, lower price, sales agreement and was assured I'd receive a check from Lucid in 30–60 days. It's now Day 34 and nothing from Lucid. I really hope I don't have to tangle with Lucid over this refund.

I have not tried the navigation, preferring to stick with Google on my phone. Rumor has it that sometime before the end of the decade Lucid will update the car with Android Auto. The SurrealSound Pro audio system, (for which I paid) sounds excellent. I laud Lucid for not paying extra to use some brand name, since nearly all car audio systems are manufactured by two or three companies, regardless of the brand on the dash.

Overall, barring future surprises, I am very, very pleased with my Air Touring. I would not have spent this amount on an ICE car. Lucid fulfills the dream of a comfortable, fully functional EV that drives with all the promise and benefits embodied in a well-executed EV. Give me another trouble-free month and I'd call it a love affair. Although we don't name our cars, my partner and I were joking about naming this car. I suggested Lucinda. She said only if it works as promised. Otherwise, we call it Lucifer. So far it's Lucinda.

If you're on the fence, it seems that Lucid worked out most of the kinks that have been painfully discussed on this forum. Thus, I recommend buying your Lucid.",2023-03-14,5.0,,,

Exactly.

After six years of driving two Tesla Model S's, and giving Lucid credit for attaining more of its EPA range than Tesla, I use the following formula for planning road trips at realistic highway speeds (80 mph):

EPA mileage x .70 x. 80.

The .70 comes from charging the battery to 90% and planning to recharge close to 20% SOC, thus using 70% of the pack's capacity. I use these limits for several reasons. Charging that last 10% takes an inordinate amount of extra time at the charging station. Planning on a 20% margin leaves wiggle room for finding a charger at the right location; encountering suboptimal weather, terrain, and traffic conditions; and avoiding low-battery stress.

The .80 comes from two things. The 4% EPA miss that Tom Moloughney found in his 70-mph range test, and the extra 11-13% range loss that comes from the aerodynamic drag for that extra 10 mph above 70 that I usually drive on interstates and other limited-access highways.

Thus, with the Dream Performance on 21"" wheels on a long road trip:

451 miles EPA rating x .70 x .80 = 252 miles.

I view this as a worst-case range. In planning trips, it allows for over three hours of driving at 80 mph (which is more than I'd want to do without a break, anyway); gives some flexibility in choosing where to recharge; and removes worry about unforeseen events along the way.

It also means I can do our most-frequent road trip (across the state from Naples to the Miami area) there and back without any charging along the way, with plenty of room to roam the Miami area. We could only do that in our Tesla Model S Plaid by charging to 100%, driving more conservatively, and risking some nail-biting on the way home.",2022-02-14,5.0,154.0,,

Here is what Lucid had to say:

Attributes or variables that can decrease driving range:


Driving at constant high speeds (>70mph)
Driving at varying speeds (using cruise control is more efficient)
Driving with headwind (aero drag increases with speed cubed)
Driving up and down grades that cause switching between motoring and regenning
Driving “enthusiastically“ with aggressive acceleration and deceleration
Using HVAC heating excessively can affect efficiency significantly. It’s more efficient to use seat and steering wheel heating.
Running cabin AC in manual mode, rather than auto (controls are balanced and optimized in Auto)
Running cabin AC outside mild conditions (roughly: <10C and >35C or 50F and 95F) (we have made changes that make the AC operate more efficient between 10C and 35C)
Running cabin AC with setpoint outside normal range (<15C and >25C)
Using the brake pedal to slow the car instead of using regen. (All energy from the moving car is lost.)
Driving with Swift or Sprint modes that are not optimized for maximum efficiency. Smooth mode is optimized for maximum efficiency.
Driving a fully loaded car (more mass means more torque to accelerate and more mass requires more energy to move car up hill)
Driving up a mountain (e.g. elevation changes of Bay Area to Tahoe)
Driving twisty roads with loads of steering input (rolling resistance is higher with steer angles)
Driving with low tire pressures (more rolling resistance)
Driving the car in a warm, humid environment, as opposed to warm, dry environment (it takes a lot of cooling energy to condensate water vapor in the air).
Efficiency of the vehicle is suboptimal at the early life of new vehicle. Particularly, optimal efficiency requires approximately 2000 miles of driving to allow the tires and drive units to break-in.

Suggested settings to optimize driving efficiency:


Use ‘Smooth’ mode in the Drive menu
Use ‘Hold’ mode in the Settings/Vehicle menu
Use ‘High Regen’ in the Settings/Vehicle menu (especially for those not used to single pedal driving)
Use ‘Auto’ and ‘Sync’ in the HVAC menu, combined with a 72°F set temperature
For road-trips use cruise control as much as possible
Use heated and ventilated seat options
I also recommend using battery pre-conditioning while the vehicle is plugged into your home charger so it will pull from the grid and not your vehicle battery to warm up the battery during the cold temps",2023-02-01,5.0,,Air GT,90.0

Because of a number of reasons, included the current super elevated gas prices, we are facing a significant shift in the number of people interested in EVs. At first blush, this is a very good thing, however, if we do not start educating the general public on the need to buy EVs based on their anticipated range needs, we are going to see a major shift of opinion against EVs. Most EVs, even with modest range potential, will be great for the day-to-day transportation needs. That is: drive to work or the store or the golf course, drive home and plug in. Repeating this each day works very well. However, given our history with gas fueled vehicles, we just think we can hop into any EV that we use day to day and drive over to grandma’s house in the next state. Well, we can do that but…
The problem is most EVs have limited range and do not charge rapidly. Most do not charge up to 300 miles in 21 minutes the way the Lucid does. Therefore, those people who will take their day-to-day EV on longer trips, will have to charged often and they will have to spend a lot of time waiting for their EV to be charged enough so they can drive on to the next charging station. This scenario will not go over well with a society used to driving for 3 to 4 hours, going 200 to 300 miles and then spending 10 minutes at a gas pump and then continue on.
If you don’t buy into this thought, then just read this article about a reporter who was anxious to drive an EV so she rent it and drove from NO to Chi and back. She rented the wonderful Kia E6 with 310 miles of range and ended up spending more time at charging stations then she slept during the trip. In the end, she longed for her gas guzzler.

The front seating and the back seating in the Air are two different kettles of fish.

The front seats are among the most comfortable I have ever found in a car. The adjustment range is immense, the leg room goes on forever, the extending thigh supports are killer comfortable, the padding density is just right for long and short hauls, and the massage function is very well executed.

My opinion of the rear seating is more complicated. I was so taken with Lucid's early claims about rear seat comfort on a par with large German luxury sedans (with which I had a lot of experience) that I was shocked on my first visit to a Design Studio to find my knees jacked up in the rear seat as much as in my Tesla, short though I am. I became so focused on this that I did not really absorb how much fore-aft legroom there was in the rear.

My view began to soften after driving over to Miami for a second visit to the Design Studio, this time with a 5'11"" friend in the back seat of our Tesla Model S. He found the back seat of the Air to be quite comfortable and said it was a vast improvement over the Tesla. At that point, I decided that other aspects of the car were compelling enough that I would live with the disappointment in the rear seats.

Our next trip to a Design Studio was to West Palm Beach, where the display car had the smaller battery pack. Now that was the rear seating position I had hoped for in the Air -- every bit as comfortable as my personal benchmark for rear seat comfort, the BMW 7 Series. But, being a power junkie, I accepted that I'd have to live with the Dream's rear seating.

Now that we've been driving the car for several weeks and carrying all manner and sizes of friends in the rear seats, we've yet to find anyone who has anything other than praise for the rear seating comfort. I've been very pointed in telling them about my own disappointment in the rear seating and really urged them to be candid in giving their assessments. Everyone has assured me the seats are fine, to the point that I no longer get in the back seat as I do in our Tesla to spare them the tight packaging. I have ridden in the back seat of the Air a few times just so friends could experience the amazing comfort of the front seats, and I have been surprised by how comfortable I actually find the rear quarters myself.

I've concluded that my initial reaction to the rear seats was born of the shock of dashed expectations between Lucid's hyperbole about rear seating in the ""space concept"" and the reality of what battery modules under the floorpan entailed.

In living with it now, I find the ""space concept"" is a real thing. The fore-aft legroom front and back is simply amazing, as is the almost inexplicable width of the cabin, and the general airiness of the cabin.",2022-02-21,5.0,154.0,,

Some responses to your questions:

Weather: yes, the weather in San Diego and the surrounding area is ideal for EV drivers. I definitely don't live here by mistake!

You asked my departure mileage: I'm not sure what you mean here. Do you mean what was my efficiency prior to departure? I typically see about 3.0m/kWh but then I do drive the car fairly aggressively and Southern California is very hilly. If are were wondering how many miles are on the car, it's slightly over 5000. If you are asking what the indicated miles remaining was on the car when I left, that would be 469 at 100% charge. That number is based on the EPA range. It is well known and frequently discussed in this forum that many, including myself, wish the car would calculate range based on actual driving history and other factors, not some meaningless EPA number. If you look at the recent Mega Poll, you will see many votes for that to be included in a software update.

My remaining range on arrival at the destination: according to the car, about 300 indicated. Again, this is based on EPA and I don't use it in my calculations. I figure my actual remaining mileage was about 230-240 if I drained the battery completely, which I would never do.
My remaining mileage on arrival home: about 80-90.

I mentioned in the video that the ambient temperature range was between 64 and 74° and so the air conditioning was on and set at 70, but not doing a whole heck of a lot.

I have never had my Lucid back to a Service Center, which is about 80 miles away. Service visits that I have had were done via the mobile service and I have been very satisfied with that. I do hope that a full service center is installed here in San Diego in the near future because we have many owners and over time we will have a greater need for it.

Thank you for the information about the BMW i4 in the Kia EV6. Those are both vehicles that do not compete in the same space as the Lucid Air, so I did not really consider them as options to this car. This does not mean they are not excellent vehicles, they just did not fit my needs and desires. The vehicles I did consider as options were the EQS, the eTron/Taycan, and the Model S Plaid. I tested of each of these and concluded that the Lucid Air is head and shoulders better than any of them FOR MY NEEDS which involves frequent round trips to Los Angeles (320 miles) to visit an ill and housebound family member. None of the cars tested except the Testa can make this trip without charging, and I am not a fan of Tesla. The BMW and Kia can't make that trip either. I have owned a non-Tesla electric vehicle since 2018 and, as such, am well aware of the challenges faced by drivers using the public charging infrastructure. The desire to make that round-trip without charging factored heavily into my decision and effectively eliminated any other EV available at this time.",2023-02-12,5.0,,Air GT,90.0

Posting this for whatever it might be worth to the community. My advisor called me on 12/31/2022 and said he had a Touring for me. I had previously canceled my old Touring order and kept my Air order because the 2022 Touring deliveries HAD to come with bubble top, DDP, and SSP…..none of which I really wanted. The deal on 12/31 was that I get the Touring at my legacy pricing, a 90 trial of DDP/SSP (I have to pay to keep, which I wont), but I am stuck with the bubble top. The color and interior were good, so I did it. I got legacy pricing plus the $7,500 tax credit for taking deliver at 9pm on New Years Eve.

For those buyers nearing delivery. Search this site for the four page delivery checklist. That list was awesome. I have some very minor items for correction, so keep an eye out when you get your car—A squeaky window shade, the left rear seat doesn’t heat up much, and a small section of loose trim inside two wheel wells. All the panels lined up and everything else seemed tight. For ~100k, I would expect none of the issues I described, but for a new car company…..not bad. 

The car has been in my garage for eight days. I have hardly driven it (25 miles), but I have played with it a lot. I have to say….I pretty much love it. Drives and handles like a dream. I have some irritation with me having to figure out the tech, but that is on me and not Lucid. One issue with the tech is how the car deals with reverse on a hill, and I’m working that out. Electrify America charging near me stinks, but with the range of this car, it’s not a major issue (my feelings may change after my first road trip). 

Something bugging me is the mobile key. Most of the time when I walk in the garage (usually to get a water or do laundry) the car presents the handles and opens the mirrors. Today, I actually wanted to get in the car, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t open the car with my cell phone :/. The fobs and cards seem to mostly work. Although, one of the fobs needed a new battery two days after I got it, and today I got a message saying the Lucid couldn’t connect the fob, which was in the car, but the car sorted that out in a few seconds. Makes me wonder if the fobs are bad.

Next step for me is to get a wrap or PPF. To help you budget, wraps in So. Cal. Seem to be running about 4K, and PPF is about 7k. I was pretty shocked by the cost of PPF.

All in all, this car is awesome and I am glad I bought it. No shade on Tesla, but I‘m glad I went Lucid-it is fresh. The Touring is a beauty.",2023-01-08,5.0,,Air Touring,100.0

No need to go over features etc as those things are covered in other posts. They are also covered in youtube and other reviews. This is simply to give my thoughts on new learnings I've had actually owning the vehicle that perhaps weren't covered enough in reviews.

Delivery Quality - I was prepared for many of the issues I had read about here. As I went through the checklist provided on this site I was impressed with the finished product. I found two items, both in the drivers seat. The left side bolster was not working....right side worked, left side did not. The lumbar support worked when using the buttons on the left side of the seat, it did not work when using the pilot panel. While I was impressed with fit and finish I'm not the best person to evaluate that. Days after receiving the car I brought it in for tinting and ppf on the front facing components of the car. The professionals were impressed with the finish, both the surfaces they placed the ppf and around the entire car.

People - It has been mentioned by others, I just did not think there would be so many people who want to talk about the car or take pictures of it. It was nice at first, it is now bothersome. Though it was amusing as I approached a stop sign and to my right was a couple leaving a restaurant. I could read her lips as she said ""What the **** is that?""

Canopy - I love the canopy. In the couple of days before a ceramic tint was applied the DFW weather was 105 degrees and sunny. I'm 6'4"" and probably closer to the canopy than most people. I could feel the heat on this bald head. However, once the tint was applied, it works beautifully! No more hot head for me. Many people here in sunny hot climates are not bothered by the canopy heat, I was. If you are tall be aware you might be deciding to get the canopy tinted. I added the tint everywhere and it looks great with the black paint....but the big reason for the tint was the heat.

Service - Unfortunately I've discovered the service is very responsive. I've discovered it because the vehicle is currently at a service center for a 12V battery issue (reported in detail by me elsewhere on this board). While I'm not happy with this event, I am impressed with the service.

Drive/Ride - I also have a 2015 S Class, a beautiful vehicle with more than 140K miles. I have wavered back and forth on which is the better riding vehicle, but I give the edge to the Air. It simply feels more in touch with the road without the floaty-ness of the S Class. The Air does have 19"" wheels that contributes to the ride quality. I suspect if I had the 21"" inch wheels I might conclude the S Class is the better ride. I honestly can't speak with authority on drivability from a sports car perspective as I have not adequately tested the Air, nor will I. At 68 years old I'm not into 0-60 times or carving through mountain roads at a relatively high speed; wherever I am you will find me about 5% below the posted speed limit.

Efficiency/Range - Through 1000 miles I'm getting 3.8 mi/kWh. Probably not a surprise given my typical speed. Love the range given our frequent road trips. No range anxiety at all.

Fast Charging - This is more about Electrify America than it is Lucid. I've used two EA sites, Denton TX (3 times) and Round Rock TX (twice). I hate the Denton site because of the position of a curb that is there. Denton is also not the site to be at on a Saturday afternoon, far too crowded on my one Saturday visit. I've also had to move the car a couple of times to find a working charger. I love Round Rock, many stalls. Overall I'm pretty pleased with EA and would feel confident on a long road trip. But I recognize my sample size is small and on a long trip I could encounter some difficulties.

Interior - Comparing to the S class there is a big difference in the interiors. I love the relative simplicity of the Air interior and its materials, my wife prefers the wood of the S Class. For both of us the learning curve for the Air panels has not been significant, a pleasant surprise for both of us. We both agree it is much simpler than the multiple layers in the S Class.

Entertainment - Not good now. I miss my Sirius XM news and sports more than I thought I would.

Would I Buy It Again - This is the But in the title. This is truly an outstanding vehicle, I love it. But, I should not have bought the Air. It is not the Air's fault, it is mine. I'm soon to be 69, I'm 6'4"" and 290 lbs on a good day, I have arthritis, and a history of back problems. This was my #1 concern when buying the car. But my love for all the engineering and bi-directional charging, in combination with a couple of reviews where people approximately my size didn't have a big concern about ingress/egress, I felt confident I could modify my method for entry/exit to have no impact on me. Initially I thought I was right......enter the vehicle bottom first, slide bottom back in the seat toward the passenger, tilt head toward B pillar, slowly duck and enter, swing feet into the vehicle. Reverse to exit. My wife cringes watching me. Once in the car there is so much room that I quickly forget the entry issue. But I am starting to feel it in my back and I'm concerned about a repetitive stress injury to my lower back. Younger people my size may not have an issue. but this aging body does. Around the 300 mile mark I got on the Gravity reservation list as an option in the event I was later bothered by entry/exit. By 1000 miles I knew I'm getting the Gravity. So I considered my options....do I keep the Air I and hope I have no issues until the Gravity comes out....or do I sell the Air and keep this old S Class until the Gravity comes out. It is going to be sold. I caution larger people....and older people whose flexible days are past them, get to a Sales Studio. I wasn't going to drive 4 hours to my nearest one, I should have.

Lotus is known for focusing on vehicle handling by keeping weight as low as possible, even at the expense of lower power.

On one hand, I understand his view that once 400 miles of real road range is attained, the emphasis should shift to weight and cost saving in the battery pack. That will certainly position the car better for the mass market. On the other hand, charging infrastructure and charging speeds are still at least several years away from making road trips to many parts of the country feasible in an EV, even at 400 miles of range. (Just look at a map of Electrify America coverage, where entire states have no coverage even in Phase 2.) Yes, you can drive cross country in an EV these days -- but only if you stay on interstates and don't venture into some of the most scenic reaches of the country.

Although Lucid may really attain 400+ miles of range in ""real world"" driving, that is premised on maintaining posted speed limits and driving in reasonably good weather conditions. Once one admits that you risk getting rear-ended driving at 70 mph on many interstates and that cold weather seriously reduces range with today's batteries, the real world starts to feel a bit different.

The Air was designed to take a 130 kWh battery pack. Many of its customers, particularly for the upper-end versions, would pay the extra cost of such a battery pack and be oblivious to the relatively minor impacts on handling. With the drivetrain efficiency Lucid has attained, the 130 kWh pack would make the car considerably more viable for true pleasure touring into some of the most captivating parts of the U.S. rather than just getting from one population point to another.

The Jag is a 2019 HSE with EVERY available option that I bought off the lot in 2018 for about $92k. They have gone down in price about $10k since. Other than Tesla, which I didn't want, the only other available SUV EV at the time was the eTron. I test drove that as well but it was way too slow and lumber-y for me. The I Pace is 400hp, dual motor (they all are), 5 seater. 0-60 is about 4.5s. We love both cars, Jag is my wife's.

As far as repairs, the Jag stranded me (needed flatbed) when its 12V battery died in 2020 had a new front motor at 38k due to severe vibrations in the old one.

Where the I Pace beats the Lucid:

BIGGEST ITEM FOR MY WIFE: she dislikes the whole regen and one-pedal driving thing. Jaguar has that, but also has an option that makes it feel exactly like an ICE car but when you hit the brakes you're actually creating regeneration. As far as I know Lucid does not do this. Zero brake pad wear at 30k when I got new tires.
Heads up display which is highly configurable
physical seat/mirror memory buttons on both seats
SiriusXM
no front motor whine
easier to park, etc. Can easily move within inches of anything, the Lucid scares me
heat pump for heater makes lots of heat right away (although not a big deal here in San Diego)
much more info about the EV (stats, etc.) available to view
much more customization of the instrument panel
air suspension
CarPlay (now wireless but mine is not)
rear view mirror screen/camera (standard now but not in 2019)
key fob with real buttons
real buttons on the door handles (all 4!) to lock/unlock
5 year warranty
all maintenance included in the warranty period
we actually have a service center in San Diego... that said, Jags and Land Rover products are notoriously unreliable and they are always overburdened.
Where the Lucid beats the I Pace:

RANGE - Jag is 220 max although advertised at 292
efficiency - Jag lifetime 2.5 M/kWh. I get 3.0 in the Lucid.
acceleration, especially in the mid range
charging speed is much faster
much quieter other than the motor whine
handles like a sports car
smoother ride
Highway assist (Jag has radar cruise but it sucks.)
infotainment is MUCH faster (this was a problem for early I Pace models but the entire system has been replaced with a better one after 2021)
3D overhead display
better looking (subjective)
Mobile Key (Jag has an app but requires a fob or silly activity key bracelet)
OTA (Jaguar has this but some require a dealer visit)
rear seat room BY FAR, width and legroom both
frunk is WAY bigger
seats are much more comfortable
interior is more modern looking (Jag is like every other Jag with lots off stuff going on)
sunshades
soft close doors
we have Frank in San Diego but the amount of cars has grown a lot and we need a service center yesterday!
Where they are similar:

sound system
fit and finish
full glass roof (although Jag has separate panels for windshield and top)

I'm not trying to gaslight you. I simply said that Bobby's statement was true in terms of comparing driving at 70 mph to driving at the higher speeds that prevail on most major highways. Neither he nor I suggested that would mean the Lucid would get anywhere near its EPA range at 70 mph.

And I don't know of anywhere in the U.S. that has 80-mph speed limits. That's a different matter, though, than what speeds people actually drive. DOT studies show average speeds on highways well exceed the speed limits. The 50-mph speed limit on the local 6-lane road I drive most frequently would more likely get you rear-ended than keep you safe. At any speed below 60 mph most cars are passing me, and some at a good clip. Local word is that the deputies don't pull you for speeding on that road unless you're doing over 65. I have radar detectors in our cars, and I've maintained speeds around 60-62 on that road often enough while driving through police radar fields without being stopped to know it's true.

I've never seen anything over 3.3 m/kWh on our car, either. When driving at sustained 80 mph speed in optimum conditions (warm, dry weather in smooth traffic on relatively flat terrain) we get around 3.0-3.1 m/kWh in our Dream Performance on 21"" wheels compared to the EPA rating of 3.9 m/kWh.

That ratio is about par for the course in EVs that use the 5-cycle EPA test protocols. In fact, the Lucid slightly betters our Model S Plaid when driving in similar conditions. The Lucid gets 78-79% of its 451-mile EPA range, while the Tesla gets around 72-73% of its 348 rated range.",2023-02-19,2.5,154.0,,

Completely agree that the 10kWh system I pointed to is simply not going to cut it in many parts of the country. But I would like to highlight a few things:
1. The LG-chem battery is pretty much a dumb battery that is controlled by the 7.6kW Solaredge inverter that is designed specifically for that purpose. Multiple batteries can be added in parallel. You can at least do three (30kWh) - maybe more, I really did not look into that in detail.
2. For a place like where I live (Bay Area, CA), the power grid is absolutely reliable - I can count the outages (over the last 8 years I've been living in this house), on my hands. The only reasons I even have the battery are:

CA's SGIP rebate program for batteries (I got $3K back for the battery in 2019).
NEM2 net metering policy imposes a penalty called Non-Bypassable Charges (NBC) on power drawn from the grid, i.e. the same unit power drawn from the grid is slightly more expensive than the identical unit power the system puts back into the grid. A battery minimizes this especially between 4pm-9pm (higher rates in that interval) when the solar panels are producing very little.
A few circuits in the house (TV/router/cable-modem/fridge/lights) are connected to a separate ""backup"" panel that keeps the lights on when the grid is down. This next point may be confusing to people and needs a lot more explanation --> this does not mean that the battery cannot neutralize the power drawn from the grid when let's say the A/C kicks in.

EV range is highly variable depending on many factors. It's the same with gas-powered cars to some extent, but the ubiquity of gas stations causes people not to notice as much.

One of the big factors with an EV is outside temperature. How cold was it?

Speed is also a big factor. Driving 80 mph consumes 11-13% more energy than driving at 70 mph, which is the maximum speed any range tester uses (for legal reasons).

Also, maximum range is provided in ""Smooth"" mode, which has the lowest horsepower and torque output. Which mode were you using?

I used the preconditioning once before an noticed after 10 minutes that the charge rate went back to about 10 mi/hr so I was expecting to see this but gave up after 20 minutes. It is interesting how the cooling rate is great for the 1st 10 minutes then really slows down. Below are a few screen shots from the app, note the bug app showing the option to turn on AC rather than off.

It appears that the AC on full consumes about 6 kW since the battery was no longer charging and in fact lost 1% SOC. I assume that would go down by at least half when driving and the interior was at a stable temperature. Taking my GT with 21""wheels, the EPA rating is 4.19 mi/kWhr. Assume that I drive for one hour at 70 mi/hr and that the GT would get 96% of EPA that Tom Moloughney got with the DE range edition at 70 mi/hr. Here is the resulting efficiency.

No AC - 4.02 mi/kWhr
AC using 3kW - 3.43 mi/kWhr
AC using 6kW - 2.99 mi/kWhr
It may not be all that surprising that Lucid owners in hot climates are seeing efficiencies in the low 3's.

I'll first provide details of my experience, as well as a comparison to a 2017 Tesla model S I owned, and my more recent 2022 Tesla M3P. Then I'll provide a summary, Ars Technica style, with the good, the bad and the ugly. As a bonus some extra info I managed to obtain on the Air Pure. This is quite a long post.

So my appointment was at noon on Friday, in downtown Montreal. The test drives were scheduled for 30 minutes only, and that includes spending some time looking at the car, so the drive portion was really short. Also, slight disappointment, the drive was only in town, no highway. Apparently when the Design Studio opens, supposedly in December, they will start offering test drives including a highway portion. I'll definitely want to do that as I could not really evaluate sound insulation and power just driving in town (in busy traffic as well).

I was lucky however that the next appointment, at 12:30, got cancelled and so I had an extra 15-20 minutes to drive the car.

We started by inspecting the car, frunk, trunk, interior. I sat at the back as well.

Overall impressions are that the car is definitely feeling luxurious, more so that my Teslas. The choice and quality of materials is very good, and fit and finish (both inside and outside) is very good as well, again better than the Teslas I've had. Lots of space in the back seat.

Nice touch also with the shades that can rise for the rear and back windows. Although I'm not sure if these would be in the Air Pure.

With respect to the trunk, I realized that although it's wide it's not so high. I don't think I could stack my two big suitcases (when going on long trips). They might fit side to side. Worst case I would put one in the large frunk. My S was definitely more accomodating for the trunk due to its hatchback design. But this is not an issue, as the huge frunk compensates.

Going to the front seat, which has a zillion of adjustments and includes massaging (will this be in the Air Pure?), no complaints except for the position of the armrest of the center console. I don't know if this car was designed for very tall people (I'm 5'7"") but I felt that the armrest was too far back and struggled to find a comfortable position. I'll definitely want to revisit that point this winter on my second test drive.

Maybe a second nitpick here is the extended front glass above the head. Yes it looks cool. But during my test drive the sun was like just high enough to be above the sun visor which was useless in that case. No doubt I would want to have a cap handy in such situations and wear the cap inside the car.

Screens are very nice and sharp. Oh and one feature I definitely loved was the 360 view around the car. So useful when going through tight spaces!

Now, one aspect I like from the Teslas, and especially my most recent M3P, is the map on the screen and its ease of use, snappiness and readability. In that sense the Lucid was a bit of a disappointment. I didn't quite like the map layout (maybe it can be changed?), and the responsiveness was really bad, trying to zoom in. Also I wish there was more screen real estate in the up part on the right, as the map was really small. It was better (bigger) when it got duplicated in the second screen below (the one that can tilt, not sure how it's called). But then you have to look quite low, on your right, to check the map. Maybe I'm nitpicking. I'm curious to hear other people about this aspect (the positioning of the map and the responsiveness).

Still on the topic of maps, I tried to set a route to navigate to a remote location (Gaspé for example which is some 930km from Montreal). And there we hit a fairly bad point for the Lucid. No infos on chargers, like how many are available and how many are in use. I don't know if this is an issue just here in Canada, but this is not good. The manager was all apologetic about this, and mentioned that there were apps that could be used on your phone to get that info. So yeah, a $215,000 (CAD) EV with subpar navigation is a big miss here.

I didn't have enough time to interact with the rest of the UI so I can't say I saw anything buggy over there. We listened to some music. I'm no audiophile but it sounded fairly good (though the one in my M3P is also damn good).

Now on to the test drive as such.

As mentioned aboved this was a downtown drive only, with traffic all over the place, so really not the best conditions to experience the car dynamics.

For sure the car feels quieter than my current M3P and my old S, at least for tire noise. We didn't go fast enough that I could appreciate the noise insulation at speed however.

Comfort, over our rough roads in Montreal, was also very good despite the car having the 21in wheels. Reminded me of my old S (on 19in wheels) which had Air suspension but no active dampers. I tried the 3 modes, comfort, swift and sprint and indeed one can feel the difference in stiffness of the suspension. I think sprint would be my favorite as the other two modes almost felt too soft.

One pedal driving was working well, although when coming to a stop I could feel the transition to the disk brakes to stop the car. My M3P is definitely much smooter in that respect. Not a deal breaker but I was expecting better from the Lucid. Could a software update improve this?

The manager also mentioned, during the test drive, that the base Dreamdrive didn't have lane centering. Ouch! This means I would have to fork $13,500 (CAD) to get that option. I would definitely skip it (and miss it certainly).

Finally with respect to power delivery. It definitely has power when you push it (especially in Sprint mode), although given the traffic conditions I was not able to test that much. One thing I noticed though was a certain lack of initial throttle responsiveness. I think I would have liked something more agressive or nervous, like in my M3P. I'll want to check that more in my winter test drive, along with the feeling of the direction since downtown was not really a place I could check this out.

So that's it, nothing else comes to mind. I'm definitely looking forward to hear about the final specs of the Air Pure (range/power), and have that second test drive in the winter, because at this point I'm not convinced. There's a lot to like, but there's a number of points as well in need of improvements as outlined in the summary below. Some can be fixed through software updates, some cannot and are design choices.

Summary

The good:

Fit / finish / luxury.
Clean UI and sharp screens.
Really good looking car.
Very smooth ride.
360 degree view.
The bad (could be improved):

One pedal driving not as smooth as expected.
Lack of responsiveness in initial acceleration.
Armrest too far back.
Trunk opening heigh limited.
Sun in the eyes due to extended glass roof at front.
Laggy nav screen.
The ugly (really, really need to improve):

No info on chargers on navigation.
Need to fork an extra $13,500 just to get lane centering.

Bonus!

In the test drive I took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about the Air Pure since it's the one I have on order.

There is still a lot of unknowns at this point, and some of what I learned is not official in any way.

For the AWD option the power should be comparable to the Touring (or maybe just a tiny bit below) and definitely way above the RWD 480hp. Hoping this one gets confirmed.

Order finalization should get done between Jan and March, with a delivery in the (early) summer of 2023.

The glass roof would be offered as an option on the Pure as well. Although as I realized, with the glass already extending so much above the front seats, having a metal roof at the back would not be a deal breaker to me. In fact my wife, sitting at the back, complained a bit about the sun during the test drive. I think she rarely sits at the back in our Tesla.",2022-10-01,2.5,,Air Pure,90.0

451,General Automotive / EV Talk,Chevy Bolt Efficiency Compared to Lucid,https://lucidowners.com/threads/chevy-bolt-efficiency-compared-to-lucid.3890/,DJL,Active Member,True,2022-05-06,609,"Blaine, WA",,"After getting my Lucid, which I simply love, I am now helping my eldest daughter in selecting the EV which best fits her needs. The Chevy Bolt EUV has caught her eye and it is something that she can afford. She is a single mom with two adopted little ones. I must say, the more I research this car, the more impressed I am. Chevy has created an entry level car that is very remarkable for those who wish to get in the EV side of cars and needs a car for local driving. At under $30,000 for the base EUV model, Chevy should capture this side of the market. What really impresses me is the mi/kWh effeciency it actually gets. While my Lucid is rated at 4.6 mi/kWh, I have never achieved anything close to that. After 6000 miles, the best I have been able to get in a measured 90 mile drive is 4.1. My typical mileage efficiency before the cold weather has set in was between 3.3 to 3.7. I tend to drive about 5 to 10 mph over the speed limit.
However, I just watched a YouTube video ( to see it, just click HERE) of a older fellow who drove his Bolt over 2000 miles from Ohio to Las Vegas getting 4.6 mi/kWh on a number of his legs. He achieved an average of 4.0 over the complete trip. He did keep his speed to just 65 mph. He noted that headwinds were a killer on his mileage efficiency, which I what I also have noted...along with low temperatues, driving fast and going up elevations. I guess he can get his efficiency because the Bolt is less than half the weight of my Lucid and he kept his speed down. 
Besides just being a basic, entry car, its main shortcoming is that it fast charges at only 55 kW so it takes a long time to charge, making it not an ideal vehicle for long trips. Nevertheles, this fellow did in!",2022-12-09,2.5,,,

If anything it's much higher and probably has much higher drag coefficient due to the nature of the car shape. 
Also what's Cd?


Very impressive from Chevy, I do agree on the weight though, it's probably weight and honestly if a manufacturer wanted to really improve efficiency, they could limit the power draw (maybe lucid should implement a power saving mode) where they control the torque and max speed on highways for full efficiency and make you understand the risks or responsibilities (slower pickup, etc..)
and I bet we would get a lot more than we do now.

Being in a luxury car, that's also 2nd as a super car when it comes to performance, a lot of us are anxious to get off the line and just get moving, and that's where most of our efficiency goes out the window I think.

I passed the 2k mark with my Touring this morning. I just want to reiterate how much I love driving this car.

So far, I have had a few issues of note:

My passenger windshield wiper got loose and stopped operating. I posted about the fix in the How To section, but the TLDR is that I was able to fix it myself in a few minutes. And I believe the cause was partially my own fault. (The auto-wipers engaged while I was drying the windshield, and the wiper got caught in my microfiber towel, thus loosening the bolt.) I leave my wipers in “off” mode now until it’s actually raining, so this issue has not come up again. And I carry a socket wrench in the trunk in case it does.
My frunk “froze” shut. On a particularly cold and snowy day here in Boulder, after driving on the highway for about 30 minutes, I stopped at a cafe and attempted to retrieve my laptop bag from the frunk. The frunk would not fully open. And then it would not close, either. Thinking the highway drive had probably left the frunk area rather frigid, I waited about 30 minutes to see if it would warm up on its own. It did, but still not enough to open. So I grabbed the edge of the bonnet with my fingers while pressing the fob button to “open” the frunk (probably a very dumb thing to do, but so be it) and I was able to pry the thing open at last. The foam gasket on the driver’s side ended up dislodging completely, while the one on the passenger side had ice stuck to it. I managed to get the foam to “stick” back on the bonnet where it belongs, though it will likely fall off again. But in the meantime, my frunk is now fully operational again. I am awaiting a service appointment to have the gasket replaced. (Their next appointment isn’t until next week.)
My steering wheel has started a very slight “creak.” This was not the case when I got the car, but over the last 2,000 miles, it has started just occasionally to creak a little bit. I’m having service look into this while they take my car for the frunk. I also let them know about the rear deck creak, even though I fixed that with the Bobby foam method. Might as well get them to replace that properly while they have the car, if they can get the part.
Other than that, the car has been trouble free. Back in December and early January, I had some software issues that required valet card resets a few times. And I had to do a “nuclear” steering wheel reset twice. But all of those issues have disappeared for me with the most recent OTA updates. No more audio bugs. No more camera bugs. No more frozen pilot panel bugs. I really think updates have eliminated those issues for me permanently. We’ll see.

So now I get into the car every day and just drive. I don’t worry about things going wrong, because they don’t for the most part. The next time it’s -14 here, I may use the trunk instead of the frunk. But beyond that, I just drive like a normal person without a care in the world.

The ceramic coating on the inside and out has made cleaning a lot easier. Which is essential for Boulder winters. I still think I’m out of my mind for going with Santa Cruz, but keeping the carpets clean hasn’t been too bad. They will never be perfect again, but they look pretty darn clean, all things considered, with constant scrubbing and vacuuming. And the Lucid winter mats. I’m looking forward to spring, when I can wash the car every few weeks instead of every few days.

Give me CarPlay, and I honestly think I’d be completely happy with this car after that. It’s not like all the other software is perfect by any means, but I can live with most of it. I’ll love whatever other improvements they make. Don’t get me wrong. But CarPlay is the only thing I am truly missing at the moment.

I’m happy with the range. I’m happy with the handling. I’m happy with the constant thumbs up and stares I get. And I’m still happy to answer people’s questions. It’s definitely a conversation starter.

Given how infrequently I see other Airs on the road here, I also like the “exclusive” nature of driving this car. However long that lasts. Knowing Boulder, it won’t be long before I see more Airs on the road regularly, though.",2023-03-01,2.0,,Air Touring,100.0

No, I find the ride surprisingly compliant, especially compared to our Model S Plaid. I can't tell you how many passengers, including rear-seat occupants, have commented both on the quietness and smoothness of the ride, even though I almost always have the car in Swift or even Sprint mode, which slightly firm up the suspension. The ride reminds me very much of the Audi sedans I've had -- taut and well-controlled, but compliant. And the Audis had smaller diameter wheels.

I think you may be a bit confused.

A larger wheel means a smaller tire, and a smaller tire means less rubber to absorb bumps and sound. 

A larger wheel will almost always mean smaller tire, and consequently, not as comfortable of a ride.

Also of note, the warning specifically says you shouldn’t launch it or use sprint mode on 19” tires and… they’re right. On the 21” tires, it launches like nobody’s business.

This requires the use of much larger batteries with more cells, heavier carbon footprint per vehicle, and higher sticker prices.
…
We are getting mixed messages from Toyota and Lexus executives at a time where a shift is taking place and—in the U.S.—200 to 230 miles of range simply isn’t competitive with the latest crop of electric cars.“

2. Plan-B: I think Tesla allows you to set the charging current. I assumed this was a default feature and would have solved my problem if I bought a 14-50 to 14-30 adapter. I was disappointed to learn that option to set the charging current is not available. That ruled out Plan-B.

3. Plan-C: I had no other option but to buy a charging unit to connect to the 14-30 plug in my garage. That was a Clipper Creek unit. The funny thing is I still have not used it even once and it's almost 4 months since I got my Lucid.",2022-08-31,0.0,,Air GT,100.0

As much as I love our Lucid Air and like our Tesla Model S Plaid and as addicted I now am to electric powertrains, if I could own only one vehicle it would be the Odyssey. While some 7-passenger EVs are finally hitting the market, they just don't yet have the range we would need for long road trips with a load of people and luggage, which is the primary reason we keep an Odyssey.

I hate to break this to your wife, but long after the kids are gone the aches, creaks, and groans of old age make the Odyssey attractive all over again.

I'm not sure that would work without a major overhaul of the Rivian chassis layout, as the Lucid motor is designed with a split rotor that sends torque in two directions through planetary gear sets on both ends of the motor. Rivian uses dual motors on each axle, with the half shaft of the left motor sending power to the right wheel, and the right motor half shaft sending power to the left wheel.

A former finance executive at Rivian is suing the company for a hostile work environment (if I remember correctly). In her filings, she claims that Lucid knew well before its IPO that it would lose money on every vehicle it sold at the reservation prices, but that they failed to disclose that in the SEC filings for the IPO. Sandy Munro has commented that the R1T looks more like a $95K vehicle than what he paid for it.

In light of the $15-20K price increases over the early reservation prices, I think it's become clear that Rivian is going to lose a lot of money on their first production runs.",2022-05-30,0.0,154.0,,

Word is that Rivian is now rushing work on an in-house motor as their loss of control of component pricing is driving up costs faster than they can countenance. Again, I have no beef with Rivian's outsourcing their motors, given their business model.

At the same time, I'm glad that Lucid chose the different path of trying to push the efficiency envelope by developing new motors with amazing volumetric and weight power density. There's room in the market for various approaches. Rivian's approach allowed them to apply resources to and focus on a very innovative feature set for rough-duty use, and Lucid's approach allowed them to break new ground in power, efficiency, and interior space.",2022-05-30,0.0,154.0,,

EVs can have a really weird effect on people. (I posted a while back about a lady near us whose husband had ordered a Tesla Model Y. She was on ""NextDoor.com"" seeking a course to take on how to drive an EV.)

One of our friends who is planning to buy an EV and has test driven the VW ID.4 absolutely refuses to get behind the wheel of either our Tesla or Lucid. I have assured him that, short of attempting anything crazy on the wide, flat, semi-rural roads out our way, there is virtually no chance of anything going awry -- all to no avail. Another friend who has already been driving his VW ID.4 for some months is likewise too skittish to get behind the wheels of our cars.

I just returned back home to Portland from my test drive at the Scottsdale studio. I agree with all that it is comfortable, quiet, handles well, with good brakes and great acceleration.

As has been reported, I have to remember to bend down low on entering the car because of the low roof rails or get my head bumped. 

I loved the car in sprint mode but was disappointed in that steering wheel effort could not be reduced to that of swift mode while leaving it in sprint. Even my wife's 2013 Audi S4 has an individual mode where you can adjust the acceleration, suspension etc to suit your taste. The steering wheel effort is perfect on the highway, but a little stiff around town and at slower speeds. For the price of the AGT, I should be allowed to adjust it to my tastes. This is one advantage of the Dream vs GT. The Dream in swift mode has the lower steering effort around town while having the acceleration of the GT in sprint mode.

One other little thing. The car at the studio was a preproduction white Dream, while the test car to drive was a white GT.

True, except that an ICE gets more efficient in colder weather.

Cold weather might exact a bit more of a range penalty with the Air than with a newer Tesla. Tesla switched to heat pumps for cabin heating a few years back, but Lucid changed its plans and stayed with resistance heating for the cabin, which can be a big battery drain.

- The batteries and the pack architecture are usually the limiting factor in how much HP a vehicle can develop. Case in point, Lucid's motors are rated for 670HP each (1340 total), but the AGT vehicle is only rated for 816HP total. My strong suspicion is that the cell design is what limits how many joules can be delivered to the motors and still meet the battery warranty and production yield requirements.
- They can cherry-pick which cells are put into a pack and which packs are installed into a vehicle (not all cells are created equally, even within the same type and model), and eek out more HP for the vehicle. The AGT-P is likely an example of this. 
- The beautiful thing about modern electric motors is that they only create as much HP as the electricity you put into them, very nearly 1:1 (the best are something like 95% efficient). If the car needs 20HP to move down the road at a given speed, the controls only supply enough power to maintain that speed. Then it's just minimizing the parasitic drags (air drag, ball bearing drag, electrical losses, etc.) to get the best mi/kWh.
- Putting higher HP motors into vehicles makes sense for efficiency because the high HP also allows for stronger regeneration. A 670HP motor can recapture much more power into the batteries than a 200HP one. 
- Accelerating hard uses more power than accelerating slowly. A light vehicle takes less power to get to speed than a heavy one. Limiting maximum speed is more efficient than driving flat out. Those rules are the same whether it's an electric or ICE car. You cannot change the laws of physics.

So to your point @Ramsnazz, and the tl;dr version: Software can be altered to get more net HP at the expense of battery life, but reducing the HP available in software doesn't make much sense except to force the driver to accelerate and drive more slowly. There may be some value in that for those of us with lead feet, but I'd want it as a ""Driving Miss Daisy"" option.",2022-05-23,0.0,,Air GT,90.0

The Dream Editions use batteries from Samsung, and the other variants use LG Chem batteries. This might account for the 6-kWh additional capacity in the battery packs of the Dreams, although they have the same number of cells as the other variants. Thus at least some of the greater power of the Dream versions might derive from more available current from its battery pack.

Also, I was told a couple of years ago by Zak Edson, the VP of Sales & Service, that the Dream Edition had a rear motor with a special metallurgy that added about 15 hp and an undisclosed but more significant step-up in torque. (However, that was before the Dreams split into two versions, and I don't know what finally made it to production.)


According to Lucid's spec sheets, all the variants with the larger battery packs have the same curb weight. I find that a little suspicious, though, as there should be noticeable weight differences between the 19"" and 21"" wheel packages alone.",2022-05-23,0.0,154.0,,

It's not the case with ICE vehicles. It is, however, the case with internal combustion engines, other factors being equal, as colder air contains more oxygen for combustion, and an internal combustion engine works, in part, off the temperature differential between intake air and exhaust air.

There are many reasons an internal combustion vehicle gets lower mileage in winter, however: it takes longer to bring an engine's temperature into its optimal operating range; oil and fluids are more viscose during longer warmups; colder air slightly increases aerodynamic drag; winter gas formulations have lower energy density than summer gas formulations, etc. (And EPA data shows the winter drag on overall vehicle efficiency is even greater with hybrid vehicles, such as your wife's Sonata.)",2022-02-13,0.0,154.0,,

Now if you’re saying that EVs suffer more in the colder weather than ICE vehicles, that‘s probably true in most cases.

He goes over the software quite in depth compared to other reviewers, but what issue would he be having during his review drive? He's talking the whole time so he's not using the radio or any streaming. Once he unlocks the car, it's booted up so it's not slow loading for him, like for us. He doesn't use a moblie key so no issues there. It didn't sound like he was using NAV so no issue there. If he doesn't set up his own profile, there is no driver monitoring failure. 

I'm sure you guys are right about not mentioning it, but the point is that these reviewers only spend MAYBE a few hours in the car and they won't experience the car the same way.

What we really need is Jon Rettinger's video, someone who owns a car, makes videos and is living with it to go through it. His review will be better than any of these other car guys for usage. Top Gear does a great job for driving dynamics though.",2022-01-31,0.0,33.0,Air Dream Edition,100.0

The power pack is DC. The car manufacturer provides the hardware needed to convert the DC (usually 400 Volt or 900 Volt) to 240VAC 60HZ so it can emulate the Utility in voltage and frequency, and not interfere within existing appliances and electronic devices. How the 240VAC connects to the house depends on the local codes which typically follow NFPA 70: National Electrical codes but have their own unique requirements. From what I have seen so far, none of the systems, the car manufacturers are providing, are designed to run in sync with the utility and require a physical switch to select which source will feed power to the house distribution panel (breaker box).",2022-10-07,0.0,180.0,Air Dream Edition,90.0

The Wunderbox is so revolutionary I'm concerned about compatibility with the solar and solar battery backup. Enphase owns a a charger company (ClipperCreek) and they plan to have a bidirectional charger available once standards are finalized (much like Lucid). I've decided to wait until all this sorts out.

Additionally, I've decided to sell the car. The ingress/egress issue is too much for my lower back. I'm on the Gravity list so I think my timing for bidirectional charging might be 2024.

Rawlinson certainly talks a good game in terms of market positioning, P&L issues, building brand identity, etc. We won't really know what his business chops are for a while, I suspect. In any case, his retaining the CTO title when picking up CEO duties suggests to me that his heart and ultimately his mind may really stay turned more in that direction.

That could be a good thing. American car makers hit their apogee as businesses when they were run by engineers who put engineering first. They began to fail as businesses when MBA's and people from the finance ranks took over the C-suite. Cadillac produced one of the longest lists of technology breakthroughs in automotive history and earned its claim to be the standard of the world. No engineer running that company would have ever let its brand get sullied by the likes of a Cadillac Cimarron.

On a related note, I hope Lucid does not try to go public any time soon. They need to get a robust product and a strong brand built before having to deal with the pressures the stock market puts on management.

A message from your moderators: now that Lucid has their online tracking system and the numbers of vehicles has significantly increased, we will be doing away with the forum tracking system, which was originally intended to track early vehicles and (color) batches.

Of course, you are still welcome to post on this thread regarding your upcoming reservation or delivery, but these will no longer be tracked by the moderators.

If you wish, you may note your current Lucid in the ""cars"" or ""signature"" section of your profile. If you're expecting delivery, please put ""pending."" Thanks to everybody who participated in the tracker in these early days!​",2022-11-15,0.0,,,

When we load up the car to go on vacation, mpg decreases. The same is true for an EV. Thus, it may not be as easy as it seems to provide accurate range readings on the display.

There could be, and probably is, a myriad of other factors that are involved. I’ve seen this conjecture going on for over 5 years with no definitive evidence. 

I do know my Tesla was my only EV where I could walk into my garage and hear the cooling fans roaring hours after I parked. I’m quite sure that sucked quite a bit of power from the battery. So I can only suspect phantom drain is caused by a variety of factors, including battery management as just one. 

BMW touts excellent battery management as one of their engineering features. Does that account for its extremely low phantom drain? Maybe, or maybe it’s just one of a variety of factors. I saw very little phantom drain on my e-tron too. That was a good thing given its pathetic range.

When you have to prioritize where to spend your limited resources on development, you can't make everyone happy. As has been pointed out, the workaround for now might be to use A Better Route Planner.
I did read that Ford, a significantly larger company, has a range planner for the Ford Lightning for towing mode that asks what you're planning to tow, weight, route; it checks weather and elevation changes and forecasts your range, taking into account these important factors. That was a very important consideration for Ford's Lightning, being marketed as a great work truck for contractors, but their expected unit volume is much higher. I don't know of other EVs that have a branded planner that takes all of those factors into consideration, and certainly not in combination with your personal factors such as the total weight load you're moving, your heating/cooling preferences, driving style, expected traffic, road surfaces, ....

I am on the latest, and surprisingly the car is in the beta category. So I was on 2.0.25 when I picked up the car, and after I came home is when I did the rest of the updates to 2.0.33 as of now.
I think I made a post a few weeks ago saying I was picking up the car in Virginia or DC and driving it back to Utah and would love to meet fellow owners or anyone along the way, you should've posted in there and I definitely would've made some time to meet up with you!
Yeah, sometimes I noticed it was late too, or it would be late to zoom in on the map before a turn, but this also made me realize one more irk that I had with the drive.
I preferred Waze and Google Maps during my drive, but when listening to Tidal, it's exclusively that. My phone nav even though connected via bluetooth would not play audio if Tidal was playing. It's because the 'source' isn't my phone of where the Tidal music is playing from but instead the app on the car. So I guess no way of getting dual sounds there from phone audio or nav and Tidal at the same time.
However, when getting a call or text message, it would interrupt Tidal and show me I have a call (from what I remember), so I think it's a very small or minor fix to allow this functionality.

I assume that Lucid choose not to have air-suspension with reasons. Air-suspension added more to I-pace's off-road capabilty and make it easier to clear obstacles.

Also, can you comment on Lucid's smart head lighting features? While I-pace is equippped for matrix lighting capabilty, it was disabled in US due to outdated us laws. The laws have been changed over a year or two now but Jaguar never bothered to activate the matrix lighting for US I-pace. I assume that Lucid has auto high beam features. How smart is it? This is a very important safety feature for me.

I think I should have asked if Lucid has adaptive high beam lighting, which keeps the high beam all the time but auto adjust according to road consitions. Here is a youtube link show how does it work in UK I-pace.






Jaguar disable the fueture for US I-pace because US regulator does not allow it at the time. With adaptive lighting is finally legal now in US, I just wonder if Lucid Air come with the feature and, if it does, what is your experience.

At the 4:52 time mark there is an interesting analysis of the effect of speed on energy consumption. By increasing speed from 60 mph to 70 mph, energy consumption in this truck climbs 48%. As we don't know the truck's coefficient of drag, it's hard to carry this over to something like the Lucid Air, but it does make the point of what speed can do to range.

And . . . we're talking a battery pack that weighs almost as much as an entire Lucid Air.

There's also interesting information about just how heavily EV trucking will be subsidized by the government during its introductory phase.

Would be great if Lucid could work with EVGo to allow this so we can take advantage of PnC with EVGo. It would be awesome if the Lucid App could store a credit card on file and then you work with external partners to add PnC and all billed through the Lucid App so the App becomes a one stop shop but until then it would be good if this was at least supported in EVGo's App

The Tesla looked like it may go almost as far as the Merc, but then it dropped quickly once it got colder and ended up finishing third. Other cars would likely do similar in various conditions. 

This is important to realize when people drive a short distance, take a look at their mi/kWh over that short distance, and then extrapolate the full range they “would” get if they drove it to empty. It’s just not accurate to make those assumptions.

The only real way to know how far you can actually get is to actually drive it from 100 down to 0. And you should never do that, of course. And even then, you’d get a different number on a different day, etc.

My question is this, since everyone holds their phone like an idiot when video, why can the mfgrs. just rotate the lens 90 degrees so the camera does landscape when you hold the phone the ""normal"" way ? Is that too much for ""software engineers"". That way almost every video we see on the news about tornadoes and hurricanes is watchable, and you have to work really hard to screw it up.

I'm always afraid I'm going to drop my camera when I hold it landscape...am I the only one who sees the problem is a simple engineering f-up ? I want a phone shaped like my Lucid key fob, but easier to operate.",2023-02-10,0.0,0.0,Air GT,90.0

Then I put it into gear, and it warned me the frunk was still open, even though it looked closed. So I fully opened it again, and then closed it, and it secured this time. But then when I put it back into drive, I got the “turtle” warning on the left side of my center cockpit screen. I panicked for a second, but then put it back into park, and then drive again, and the warning went away. Hasn’t come back yet. 

So there may be some software connection between open funks and turtle mode, in other words. And perhaps your car’s computers are in a state they can’t get out of easily.

They had gassed up their cars as much as they could, but gas stations ran out of gas three days before the hurricane hit.

The problem with buried powerlines is that if one needs more, one needs to trench out the lawn. That is my problem. I would love to add a large dedicated line for charging a BEV but the most my electrician was able to get was a 20 amp circuit (part of my 225 amp service).

Yes. One phrase in the Edmunds article immediately jumped out at me:

"". . . this is the first time in more than 50 tests that a vehicle has underachieved its estimate by such a margin.""

When Edmunds tested a Dream Range version, they got very near its EPA rating (505 vs. 520) -- as near, in fact, as other EVs have gotten to their EPA ratings when those ratings were based on the more-conservative 2-cycle EPA protocols.

This should have triggered every alarm bell at Edmunds that something was amiss either with the car or the testing, and they should have chased that to ground before rushing to publish this test result.",2023-03-10,0.0,154.0,,

I think one needs to compare the cost of a power wall (if one has solar roof), a generator, and the Lucid V2H costs. Then realize that the V2H will eventually run out and limit your mobility when comparing the cost to the other alternatives.

I think V2L is probably a more cost effective alternative. In a power blackout, what are the main concerns? Mostly refrigeration. So plugging the refrigerator(s) into the car can protect your food supply. If you need to cook something, temporarily disconnect the refrigerators.

In my experience with Teslas (forgive me for always bringing up Teslas), that is indeed the case. The greatest degradation happens within the first year. Collectively our Teslas now are about five to six years old. They all experienced their greatest loss of range within the first two to three years and 50,000 miles. We’ve lost 9% to 10% of our original range. Historically, and from what the Tesla forums and Tesla apps have been tracking, we can expect battery degradation to be very incremental, especially after the 100,000 mile mark, probably less than 1% loss per year.

But that’s all Tesla. I’m waiting for more data points to be produced to see how Lucid batteries fare over the long haul. Maybe in time app developers will develop tools that can track things like this for Lucids. Right now, ten years since the first Model S was sold, the Tesla universe is replete with apps developed indepently - TeslaFi,TezLab, Tesla Stats, Tessie, etc, etc, etc…

Finally, you’re correct. Running the battery down from 100% to 0% is NOT a good idea, especially when you want to preserve your battery.",2023-03-06,0.0,,Air GT,90.0

How are you determining range? Are you looking at “ since last charge “ or by trip. 
It seems unusual to get 25 % of range , even in city. If you are making that determination by looking at “ since last charge “, that will considerably underestimate your true range as it takes in consideration phantom drain, drain while car is preheating, etc.
I live in a very cold area and my driving is mixed . Even in town, I never ever get 25% in winter, I get about 60-70 of the range I get in warmer times. 
As far as the heater, I would recommend preheating car and using seat and wheel heat, in conjunction with forced air. I haven’t had instances of getting cold in the car, even at temperatures close to minus 20 Fahrenheit, when using all options in concert. Once the cabin warms up, it has stayed that way for me.

We drove it 847 miles in the first 24 hours. We had bad experiences attempting to charge at EA. 5 of the 6 times we charged resulted in a telephone call with both Lucid service and EA service on a 3 way call to get a complimentary charge. One time we were able to get the charge started with the help of the Lucid app. We had our Nav attempt to reroute us to another state and city no where near our route, lose the position of our car and not be able to show us where we were along the route, and finally the nav was unable to locate any charging stations. We charged often because we were eating up 2 miles of charge for every mile we actually traveled, possibly because the car was new, it was cold out, and windy. Our cameras did not auto engage when we parked next to a curb, the cameras quit working all together when we signaled to change lanes for several hundred miles and then started working again after a reset. Our Pilot panel froze with the word AIR displayed, and the radio would come and go on its own. Lucid support had us soft reset the car several times along the way, with some positive results. The car went in for 2 days of software service along with paint correction in 8 different places. They also noticed our trunk entry panel was in need of replacement (which they did) and they also noticed the trim at the top of the hood needed to be replaced (which they also completed). John, and the other service people at the Scottsdale SC are really very knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly. Since the service was completed, we have not had much opportunity to drive the car recently. On the few occasions which we have, the cameras operate about 50% of the time. The Nav and Sound System seem to be working just fine. I did take the car to the same EA station Lucid service used, and plugged and charged as it should.

You need to plan accordingly or have a very good planner in the car to factor in charging stops etc. so far, Tesla seems to be the only one that has this working well.

People also don’t understand charger hopping where the intention is not to charge the car to 100% but charge the car to get you to the next charger. I’ve seen time and time again people over charging a car at a location when it does them no good because they still have to stop at the next location. It’s also taking up time at a charger where someone else could be using it.

Charging curve and power delivered are also critical for people to understand. Not all chargers are treated equal and have different voltages and amps being delivered into them. This means that if you don’t understand your car is supposed to charge at 200Kw for the first 10 mins before decreasing this is a problem because if you’re only getting 100Kw then it’s likely something is wrong with the charger and you need to stay longer or swap to another one. I was talking to a Taycan owner at a charger once and it was charging at 40Kw. He thought it was normal. 

The lower you arrive at the charger the better. Arriving with lower charge level will allow you to get the fastest charge possible initially. You’ll never get 300kw on a Lucid arriving with a SoC of 40%

I hope this will help others who are new owners or contemplating ownership.


Ride quality has improved and it now is much smoother over bumps. I like it a lot now
Steering was initially very heavy and now is much better (i.e. not so heavy/hard, more middle again, like the suspension). I am waiting for the ability to adjust steering resistance (e.g. comfort, sport) which would be even better. 
Audio - initially I thought Burmester in Porsche was better but I have really come to appreciate this sound system. Now I probably think it is the best OEM that I have heard. Needs a good source though (e.g. Tidal Dolby Atmos) otherwise, spotify doesn't utilize the systems fidelity enough.
Range - still a big disappointment. For reference, I have aftermarket, non-aerodynamic winter wheels + Bridgestone Blizaak LM005 winter tires, inflated to 49 psi, 50% hwy 60-70mph, max regen. Below freezing I was getting 1.8-2mi/kwh. At 8-10 degrees celcius I'm getting 2.8-3mi/kwh. Honestly, a big downer for me
Fit & finish - except for the constant rear shelf noise issue, mostly in the cold (which has been attempted to be fixed 2x already by SC), interior is a wonderful place to be. Materials are very high quality and fit and finish are great. The leather is some of the nicest feeling leather I've encountered vs porsche (911s, cayennes, taycan, panamera), benz S class, BMW, Ferrari, Lambo. I would go as far as saying it is closer to bentley quality than the aforementioned list. A minor issue in the back seat is that the floor is quite high so despite lots of leg room in front of your knees, it can be a bit uncomfortable because it almost seems like the seats are too low on the ground and knees are not supported 
Navigation - As I use it more I am finding it isn't as bad as I thought. Miles better than other OEM systems that don't use carplay/android auto or google maps natively. Not as good as tesla but useable, although I always double check with google maps on my phone so I don't trust it completely yet
The car sits so low that you are more likely to scratch or bottom out than any other sedan I've driven (except maybe the performance sedans like M5, c63, etc, although I'm not sure). You'll bottom out going over larger speed bumps and steep driveways. I would compare it to driving a sports car like R8, Corvette, Lambo, Ferrari - given it's longer wheelbase, it bottoms out more frequently than a 911
Still no highway assist in Canada, which sucks, and no timeline for arrival. All I have is adaptive cruise control, which functions essentially the same as $30k cars.
Charging - fastest I've got is 168kw @ 10% SOC, preconditioned for 20min, but I'm not sure if this is more a function of our immature rapid EV charging here in BC (Canada)
Issues I've found that came about as I lived with and drove the car:

clamshell trunk isn't a very good design. It looks super wide but it's very low so you are always having to duck into the trunk and it's height opening is quite small. Lifting the false floor reveals a larger cargo area underneath but then you are literally bending over to pick up anything you put in there (e.g. briefcase) and I'm only 5'8""! The car sits so low which wosens this whole experience. Also, when it rains, the design of the trunk is such that the water beads off and drops on my head if I'm getting something from the trunk as the lip is directly over the opening of the trunk! If you go to costco and need to shove things to the back, getting it is akin to climbing through the cylindrical tubes in a playground where you almost have to disappear into the trunk to fetch the bags.
Software - unfortunately, with time, I think all owners will fall victim to the software gremlins that continue to plague the car. I was in honeymoon phase until recently when I reset the car to try to reactivate the voice navigation guidance and audio text message and all the gremlins are coming one after another. I've made my opinion before about the software; to me, it is inexusable for lucid's software to be so far behind. Think of it like blackberry releasing an OS similiar to their original but far inferior to the experience of iOS or android - they'd get eaten alive. No excuse to not be at least equivalent to Tesla, the market leader, with some additional ""thoughtful"" features to make it feel special. 
Rear camera occasionally has a very short lag such that it risks you/me bumping into something if we are too fast
Regen in reverse - who needs such aggressive regen when reversing? It should be programmed to be lighter to make parallel parking, backing up into spots, easier rather than being a jerky processes
Seat comfort - this is subjective but I find it a bit hard to get totally comfortable in the seats. Initially they feel very comfortable but there is something there that makes my back ache. Seats in the EQS SUV are more comfortable for me but maybe it's just my body shape? Don't know - again very subjective (for reference, I'm comparing the seats to tesla model X, MB EQS SUV, Porsche Cayenne sport seats, sport cars and even rented hyundai/kia small SUVs and vans like sienna and pacifica. For some reason, I just have trouble not hurting in these seats)
Intermittent wipers - just as bad as tesla - far inferior to accurately determining when to turn on or off or frequency of wiping than Toyota, honda, hyundai, etc. 
Servicing/bugs/warranty issues - I've had my car for 3 months and it's been in the service centre for 1.5 weeks total, which I think is a lot for a new car. I would worry if this was my only car and I had to rely on it as dependable transportation, which when I think about it is stupid because isn't that primarily why we buy cars?!
homelink integration is the worst that I've experienced in a car. I have my physical garage door opener in my car and don't use homelink at this time until they fix the geofencing/rear camera issues
Still not sure how to have the mirror/seats automatically adjust for my profile vs my wife's. When I arrive to the car with my linked key, it changes the profile to me but doesn't adjust anything despite me setting it to adjust all settings when the profile is detected. So I sit sideways in the car with my head crouched (in my wife's seating position) then go to seat settings to ""restore"" my seating position and then I can fit but sometimes mirrors don't adjust to my saved settings. Gremlin?
BEWARE the frunk lid - it will close on your head very fast if you're not careful and aware
Headlights are great - very bright at night, providing excellent vision
App - It's tesla's app from 2011-2016 (i.e. limited functionality). Better than most/all legacy maker but quite far from Tesla
Vampire drain - quite significant in the cold. I can lose up to 10+ miles overnight in a nonheated, insulated garage with ambient temperatures of -5 celcius. Much more than my tesla

Even my old Tesla p85d was upgraded from insane to Ludicrous mode this way with one hardware change( the main battery pack fuse)If that can’t be achieved over the air then certainly at a service center.

Did some research and found a HyperFast EA charge station at the outlet mall in Cabazon, CA so I set that as my first stop. Charged the Touring (with 20"" tires) to 100% at 382 miles. The left side of the screen showed 102 miles left at destination, so that gave me a nice sense of comfort. The drive to La Quinta is a hilly one. Las Vegas is around 2,000 ft elevation. You have to cross Mountain Pass at around 4,000 then drop to around 2,000 before climbing back up over 4,000 before dropping back down to Baker. Then you do a steady climb to Cajon Pass (again around 4,000) before dropping back down before the I-15/I-215 split. 102-mile reserve dropped steadily as we climbed but did not nearly reciprocate on the downhills. We arrived at Cabazon with around 45 miles of reserve.

Spent 3 days with friends before the drive home. Left around 8:15am heading for Cabazon but the EA charge icon did not show up. Luckily we were still in La Quinta so we drove to the station off Highway 511 in Palm Desert (150Kw). I charged to 80% thinking that would get me to Barstow. with 95 miles of reserve. Found out when charging that the Cabazon icon lit up. They open their chargers at 9am. Got to Barstow but the charger at Walmart was broken so continued to Baker. I called EA to ensure that the chargers at Baker were working; otherwise we were SOL. Got to Baker with 28 miles of reserve. Charged to 80% and we were home-free.

Some observations: You can guess that the reserve estimate is only an estimate at best. It probably assumes that you are driving in the Midwest where everything is flat. I would at best drop this by 50%, more if you are driving a hilly route. I would not go past 250 miles on a FULL charge, and 200 miles on a refill. I'm sure many of you also notice that the charge rate drops as the percentage goes up, presumably so you don't fry the batteries with an overly aggressive charge rate. Or it is to prevent the charger itself from overheating (probably the latter more than the former but I don't know for sure). I had 50% success rate with the chargers. I ended up calling EA for assistance. To their credit, I got someone every time I called, so thumbs up for their customer service. I think it was a combination of some of the chargers and my lack of familiarity with the Lucid app. I think the correct procedure is to wait until you plug in and then hit the lightning bolt on the app. Electrify America should pop up and you have to confirm which charge station you are plugging into. If I have this wrong, someone please correct me.

Baker had the most EA chargers that I saw, around a dozen. I was envious of the banks of chargers from Tesla that were at most 20% occupied and it seemed like they were all working. It also seemd like they were everywhere. The EA charger closest to my home says 150Kw but I've never gotten more than 30 at initial and it drops to 20 very quickly. Was thinking of a Route 66 trip to Chicago this summer but my first trip cooled my jets for that. I will drive it to San Diego in June but still in the air about driving it to Tucson next month. I think it will be a while before EA catches up to Tesla in charger availability; I'm sure my 3-year free charge with EA will expire long before that. If/when Tesla opens their chargers to everyone, my anxiety will do way down.

Oh, almost forgot to mention my drive - it was amazing! Nothing but happy vibes! I averaged around 7 miles over the speed limit so that probably contributed to the drop in range. Car wants to ""center."" I tend to drive around a foot towards the center lane so the car wants to ""jerk"" the steering wheel to the right. It was a little disconcerting until I just learned to trust the technology and - problem solved! I held the steering wheel loosely and the wheel would slip through my fingers as the car centered itself. Will so many cameras on the car, I still tend to look over my right shoulder when I'm backing up. My daughter looks at the glass and hits the pedal. Old dog needs to learn new tricks lol! We drove in full sun for the entire trip and I did not notice any heat buildup in the interior whatsoever. I'll wait until the Vegas summer heat before a final verdict but I don't think it will be an issue. We love the glass roof so far.

Had trouble setting up Tidal but customer service got me hooked up in a matter of minutes. That said, I was not impressed with it, maybe because of the content (not my type of music). We used Sirius and loved it. I could not find a way to turn the radio off though or make the volume of the nav system louder without increasing the volume of the radio.

I would give my trip a C average.",2023-02-13,-2.0,,,

The scary part is the turtle icon which I am fortunate enough to never encountered.

In order for Lucid to thrive, they need to have positive image of stability, not just demonstration of future financial stability, software stability as well to boost buyers’ confidence. My son loves riding Air for comfort, but he prefers going around places in his smaller agile Polestar 2 which never have to do soft reset since 4 months of ownership. Only problem he ever had was with EA and its mobile app couldn’t remote lock/unlock doors which took them an OTA Update cycle to resolve. Polestar may only OTA update once every 2 months, but each update was meaningful and QA validated not breaking other things to frustrate its owners. To me that is good business execution. Imagine when Lucid releases more Air in the wild, every update create bugs which compound the complaint noise, that is terrible company image.

I think the biggest failure in their planning is that they didn’t plan (allow) for more time. I should say more specifically, a longer trip time. 

Perhaps I came down too hard on these two soi-disant ”journalists”, but it shouldn’t have taken them that long to work out that the trip durations they were anticipating were just not realistic. 

Then too, with the free, unlimited supercharging that comes with our Teslas, I’ve been a spoilt Tesla EV owner all these several years. For a few years now, we have been able to plug and charge our Teslas all the way across the country. We road trip in our Tesla without giving it much thought other than allowing for longer trip times.

The conclusion:
Being an EV pioneer was definitely a thing a few years ago.

Especially when the pricey car itself doesn’t ride nearly as well or has nearly as nice an interior as its German competitors.

Starting with this an EA 30KW./Hour charger... From 0 to 18%, we should be getting close to 300 KW/Hour. It begins falling and by 35% it is down to 250 WH/Hour, by 55% down to 150 KW/hr and so on. So charge rates do very legitable. If I had ever gottten to within 10% of the charge rate on any of the EVGO or EA chargers, I would say, my car is charging properly. Lucid would tell us every EA and EVGO charger is falsely advertising it's charge rate. That would be grounds for a class action suit. I would accept that some chargers may be defective in some way, but I see that some folks have been able to achieve the published charges rate somewhat consistently. I am going from very forgiving of all the service calls, because up till now, Lucid has responded and corrected non-software issues. The fact that Lucid is refusing to address this isse has me regretting my GT purchase. Support was one of my concerns when I bought it, but up till now not an issue. ... Also to repeat, my lucid was in the service center and they discovered assembly issues in my charge circuit. I believe there are still issues and that the kind of charge issues I have had may be more common than we realize and that it is NOT ALWAYS the charger, This is an old chart and I believe that Lucid has supposedly 
improved since then.

That just may be the case with Lucids. I wish I could find out for certain. 

Again, bringing up my Tesla ownership experience, early indications of battery degradation happening almost from the start of ownership could be seen when your car finished charging. For example the first few times we charged our car to 100%, estimated range came right at Tesla’s advertised spec - 295 miles. It stayed at that number for the next few times we charged at a 100%. 

Within a few weeks however, that number started its inexorable slide downward. Quickly at first, with estimated miles dropping to 280 within the first year, and then more incrementally after that. Coming up on five years and 85,000 miles later, that same Tesla registers the same estimated range at 100% that it has for almost a year - 268 miles. In other words the degradation rate has stabilised to a more gradual, almost imperceptible level. 

I’m surmising that since their battery chemistry is very similar (lithium ion), Lucid batteries will degrade in the same manner that Tesla batteries do, with degradation and loss of range happening most dramatically within the first few years and 50,000 miles of ownership, and tapering off to a more gradual rate after that.",2023-03-06,-2.0,,Air GT,90.0

I’m above 8k in miles right now.

The software was horrific until 2.xxx updates came through. The camera software is still painful and the car desperately needs CarPlay and Android Auto to accommodate for the overall needs of the driver and lack of beyond acceptable software at this point. I recently saw a Lamborghini with a digital instant always on rear view mirror and considered seeing how simple it would be to mod mine to have it. I’m hoping Lucid will eventually get to the point where they can focus on more luxury software features like enter/exit seat/wheel adjustments. Not having easy access to my podcasts/Apple Music/apple maps has been a nuance that I’m not fond of coming from almost every other EV I’ve owned to date.

My biggest issue with the car has hands down been customer service. Lack of responses, indefinite repair time frames and what appears to be a lack of care for the customer has tainted my experience here. Once Lucid produces the Pure (soon) and actually scales deliveries, I’m watching if this degrades or improves. If it doesn’t improve, it may lead me into a different direction with my next vehicle. When an issue has been addressed, thankfully it HAS been addressed on my end. Recently, I have had trim peaces falling off the top back wheels that I have not heard back from customer service on yet (my #1 issue).

On the positive note, I almost have no regrets with the car beyond customer service and software issues. Everything has been extremely pleasurable from a drive perspective. More so than any of my other EVs. I’ve received more compliments and conversations on this vehicle than I ever did in the early Tesla days, or my Porsche when the Taycan released. It’s been phenomenal. Driving is extremely sporty, and although I didn’t splurge on the AGT-P and have the AGT, it’s far more than enough power/performance wise to do what I want. I hug the ground when I drive and feel full control.

I think I was the first in the forums to also remove the sun visors. This is the way. Hoping Lucid will lean into improving on that area in the future as it feels extremely half baked. Removing them made a world of difference experience and enjoyment wise for me.

On the note of exit/entry though, if a revision comes down the line (Or when the cheaper than Pure model enters the fray), as much as I like sporty cars the pillar arrangements do cause issues for all ages getting in/out of the back seats. That’s one large feedback item I wish would be addressed.

Issues I’ve hit so far: Turtle mode on delivery (oil was wrong in my motor), trim issues on side (they came and replaced it… with 3mm tape which apparently holds it on), trim below wheel, 1 21” tire blew out, front latch wasn’t latching closed via electronic close, squeaky wheel.

To put this into perspective:

2013 Model S issues: Dead MCU unit, Oil Leak (yup), all 4 door handles broke over time, charge port broken 3 times, trim issues, rear passenger window dropped driving on the highway, bad center console installation

2021 Taycan issues: none…

I believe you missed the whole point I was trying to make. I respectfully suggest you go back and carefully reread it. However, in an attempt to be even more clear, let me try it again. 1) I love my Lucid. 2) The Chevy Bolt EUV is cheap but is appears to be a very good entry EV. 3) It gets very good mi/kWh and it appears it maintained closed to that efficiency over a fairly wide set of driving conditions since it average 4.0 mi/kWh from Ohio to Las Vegas. 4) I have only achieve 4.1 mi/kWh once and am lucky to get in the mid 3s under normal driving conditions. 5) My guess is that the car gets such good mileage efficiency because it is less than half the weight of the car.
Since I have my Lucid, and just love it, I know there is a big difference between the two cars on so many factors. To quote someone famous: ""Duh!"". I am just surprised the very cheap Chevy gets and then maintains, a better mileage efficiency than the Lucid and I can not get to the high mileage efficiency that Lucid is rated at. In fact, after being in this forum for most of this year, I believe that very few Lucid owners have achieved and maintain it often.

I really like the car but there are a few problems starting to surface. The first being Electrify America is not good at all. You don’t even get the charge speed thats stated on the station. I have had the car go completely dead after charging. I am able to get things going again by opening up the app. This has happened at least three times. It is not the car going to sleep because I watch and you get a warning that the car is about to go to sleep and you can stop it that way. I took my first road trip to central Illinois. About 229 miles one way. Going was fine as car performed beautifully. I love the adaptive cruise and lane asssist and it works very well. I finally charged at a 350kw charger in Bloomington Il and it worked very well. No error codes or anything just plug in and it works. That never happens in Schaumburg as you always have to unplug and plug back in. I was driving back on Sunday and about 130 miles from home got an error message on freeway and car went i to turtle mode. I went as far as I could and pulled off the freeway and called customer service who instructed me to try and do a reboot. In the meantime I requested a tow trucks just in case the reboot didn't work. I was able to get the car to reboot by using the key fob to lock the car and walk away for 15 minutes. Then come back to car and press the key fob twice and lights came on and horn beeped. Got back in car and orange triangle was gone and was able to drive back home without any more issues. I have no idea why this happened as car was driving fine and this literally came out of the blue. I will schedule a seevice visit to have the car checked out. I really like the car and all in all in works very well most of the time. The turtle mode thing does have me worried as I like to take long trips. Car only has 1100 miles on it. I sent one of the car getting its first EA charge. I'll send more later.,2023-01-23,-2.0,,Air Touring,100.0

And when you don't go the way it wants, it has a hard time ""Recalculating"" the route. I took a short cut yesterday and it kept on trying to recalculate (and failing) until I got back on the route it had selected for me – on the return trip it routed me using the shortcut.

Street name pronunciation is probably a bit worst than most other nav systems. It has a hard time with street suffixes such ""Place"", which are abbreviated as PL (it wants to spell out each letter). The voice seems to be inconsistent too, as sometimes it sounds very kind, but other times it is very stern. It says, ""TURN LEFT NOW!"" about 500-750 feet before a street. Of course, it's use of both screen at the expense of the entertainment sources, is a well known limitation.

It's a shame they don't have a better navigation system. It reenforces the need for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Once they have that worked out, I doubt I will be using much of their UI, which is really sad, considering the ""effort"" they put into it and the waste of resources in the car I paid for. I'm sure they are trying to figure out how to properly display the CarPlay/Auto information, given their non square upper panel. Maybe it will be a smaller area and possibly a swipe down will reveal a larger UI in the lower panel.

If Moloughney got only 404 miles out of the range test, that would have been one of the biggest misses against EPA range he'd ever seen in a range test.

Would like some feedback: 

I drove from my home in Palo Alto to my work in LA yesterday, a distance of 312 miles. I had been led to believe that that was a reasonable range if I kept the speed on I-5 under 75. I arrived at work with a mere 20 miles left. So, it's uncomfortable in that respect. Is this the experience of others? I noticed:

1. The car was steady at 3.3 m/kw
2. The ""miles remaining"" indication is inaccurate and poorly calibrated. For every mile I traveled, the range remaining went down by an average of 1.35 miles. (This is one of the only two things that my Tesla did better.)
3. of note, I stopped at the EA at Harris Ranch on my return. There were 8 charging stations. Only 3 were functioning. One of those did not recognize my Lucid. Only two of 8 did, and those worked well. No doubt, EA is a problem. (This is the other thing, at Kettleman, there were over 60 functioning Tesla superchargers that all worked - whenever I tried them.)

2.9 mi/kWh has been my very consistent average. I’ve historically always been on Smooth but recently started changing to Sprint because I like the feel better and it doesn’t seem to impact my efficiency at all. My best has been between 3.4-3.6 and this was briefly when driving down the Florida Keys. 2.8-3.1 is my typically range and frankly, I’m a pretty darn well behaved driver.

This vehicle basically has the same drag coef and battery size as the 580 EQS. Not sure why I expected something magical optimization wise, but I’ve rejected any notion of that existing. This basically gets the same average 320-340 miles on a single charge with 21” wheels my EQS was getting driving the same in pretty much everywhere across the East I’ve driven with both. I’m honestly not impressed considering what’s been advertised, but I’m also not dissatisfied as it’s the sweet spot range for an EV.

I will note the EQS hit closer to the higher range values more than my AGT, but this maybe due to optimizations around speed output and overall HP differences.

It is sad to hear that @hydbob stated range at 100% charge currently is 445 when his Dream Performance is rated for 471. His degree of range loss is well beyond that which would be expected. During the first year, his range should not drop much below 460.

Previous owners have posted similar remarks without our group following through on this concern. Although there may be multiple reasons for the problem, I see two obvious possibilities: 1: The software does not calculate the range correctly. 2: Individual cells are going ""dark"" prematurely. 

I have concerns the problem may be related to scenario #2. If you watch Peter's video on the battery construction, each battery pack contains 300 cells that are connected by 600 delicate aluminum straps using pressure alone. NOTHING is soldered. The plate and straps are made in a single injection moulded technique. For this to work, the injection moulding must be perfect. In addition, great care must be exercised during installation to prevent bending one of the 600 straps. These are the same folks that put Tahoe door panels into a Mojave interior. In addition, road vibration may affect these tiny straps. Attached to this message is an image of a battery plate from Peter's video.

Further investigation would seem to be in the best interest of all owners (present and future). For this reason, I would like to initiate a SURVEY OF ALL CURRENT OWNERS. Please answer the following questions:

1. Type of car (Dream Performance, Dream Range, or Grand Touring)
2. Tire size (suggested by @hydbob)
3. Current mileage
4. Stated range when your car is charged to 100%.

If this reveals no problem, then GREAT! If multiple owners reveal significant range loss, then it would seem prudent to have the vehicles inspected at a service center. If would be really interesting to discover if @hydbob battery in his Dream still demonstrates 118KW. If not, cells have gone ""dark"" prematurely. If the battery still registers 118KW, then the software needs to be updated.",2022-04-21,-3.0,,Air Pure,90.0

First EV’s have to get to the point where they get close to the stated range when driving it like a gas car. On my BMW‘s I could drive 80 plus on trips on freeways and not affect range that much. On my Refresh Model S it affects range a lot. 

Secondly, if one travels a lot like I do, I think the range must increase or at least like in my first point be realistic to get the stated range. I would love to have more 500 plus rated EV’s that don’t cost a fortune to own.

Third, EV networks need to be build out much better and be extremely reliable. I think Tesla is by far the best, but even they have more catching up to do with building out their network and making their chargers faster. Gas people think I am crazy to sit and charge for 20 to 30 mins.

I can ""guarantee"" that I can't get anywhere near 3.4. I can pull out of my driveway - go 1/2 mile down the county road to the stop sign, take a left, drive 1200 feet to another stop sign and then 12 miles at 55 mph to the grocery store. There are no stops on that 12 mile journey. I'll get - at best - 3.0. That's on cruise. Going another direction - it's maybe 16 miles - basically the same scenario - that one is 70mph at parts but generally 65. I usually get around 2.8. 

I've done it enough times to know that 3.0 appears to be where my car sits. That would put my 100% range around 276 miles. 

As far as the 12-15% drop - that's pre-calculated in my vehicle range. 100% charge does not indicate 425 - it's 386. But it won't go anywhere near 386. Yesterday was 200 miles and I might have been able to make it 240 - with a starting range of 339.

I live in North East Texas. We don't have 80mph roads. The fastest you can go legally is 75 on some stretches of I-30 and I-20. And those roads are 30 miles from here.

Perhaps Lucids perform differently on the East and West coasts. But in NE TX I get - at best, lifetime average - 3.0 miles per kw. I've never seen anything over 3.3. 
Today - I need to go to the grocery store. Since the guessometer has been updated - I'll put the destination in and see how well it predicts arrival range. I'll turn off HVAC and will leave around 12pm - that way the temp will be 61. My guess is - 30 miles (round trip) and it will cost me 10kw. And the max speed will be 55mph.

I'm not really complaining - other than the completely BS range ratings - the car is fantastic. But I don't see - In my wildest dreams - the car ever getting anywhere near 3.6 mpkw. What's even more frustrating is - my range has been pre-depreciated. It would be one thing if a full charge showed 425 (as advertised) and I could subtract the 15% or so for the 21"" wheels. But they've pre-calculated a 10% reduction right off the top. And, what it appears is, I'm getting an additional loss of 20%-25% on top of the predicted loss. That translates to a 35% drop from ""rated"" range - or 276 miles on a full charge (to zero) - which appears to be exactly what I'm seeing.

However, Homelink is a mess. When I arrive home, there is no geofencing, so I have to press the Homelink icon. My driver profile comes up, and I have to press the Homelink icon again within that menu. Then I have to press and hold the button for a couple of seconds until the garage door begins to open.

I stopped at several different Electrify America and EVGO charging station. Based on published charge rates and charts, expected to see close to 300 when the battery was below 20% and for the rate to start declining as it becomes more fully charged. The fastest charge rate I observed was about 168 KW. I had just gotten my Lucid back after they repaired the charge system. The car had bricked itself completely. Field support came out and opened a panel behind the left rear tire and hooked in and unbricked the car. They then put the car on the 240V charger and watched for a couple minutes, and then left. The car then before they could get a block started throwing messages and the charge indicator went red. The towed the car the next day to a service center. They found partially disconnected wiring in the charge circuit. Anyway, I got my car back and soon departed on a 1500 mile journey. I spent way m ore time at the charging stations than I had anticipated. I had been making mental notes on all the charge rates. Sometimes, I started charging at 40% and sometimes it was under 20%. This was 6 EA stations and 2 different EVGO stations, all at 350KW ratings. 

I opened a ticket on my slow charging situation, and the field support forwarded it to the ""Battery Team"". The battery team made a claim they saw 220 KW/Hour which is well short of what I should have seen. I never saw 220 and had some screen shots of what the station registered and the car registered. Regardless, I ran the car down to 15% and then preconditioned the battery for 23 minutes. At the closest EVGO 350 KW station, with no one else drawing power from the many station / nozzles, I plugged in again. This time I watched very closeley and took screen shots and pictures of the consoles. For a few seconds, I did get almost 220, but it then dropped to 200 and fluctuated down to 180 and back up. By the time I got to 20% it was down to the 180 range and dropping. I stopped the test at 41%. So based on Lucid's claim of 300 Miles in 20 minutes and based of the published charge rates, I am getting about 60-66 % of what is expected. Since Lucid had been refusing service, I sent them all the screen shots. They said they would escalate it and someone from the team would contact me within a couple of days.

I have had the car since Dec 30th 2022. Do not get me wrong I am in LOVE with it. The issue I have been dealing with is Turtle Mode. On Feb 5th - Sunday. I was leaving on a business trip. Was leaving town and getting onto the interstate when I couldn't accelerate faster than 51 MPH. I have seen post on here with much lower speed thresholds. I pulled off onto next exit and called service. It was a Sunday. But was on hold for 40 minutes. I had been googling other options while I waited on hold. So did a few of the resets as I understood them. Nothing would work. Got the service person on the line and he had me do the resets with Key going completely out of area as well as the valet key option. Noting worked. He said he would schedule to have taken to a nearby facility early in the week. Keep in mind I live in South Dakota. I took another car and left on my business trip - giving them my husbands number to contact for pick up. They called back on Monday and had him try a few options as well as making sure Trunk, frunk and all doors were closed. Nothing would take it out of Turtle Mode. They then deiced to have it picked up and taken to Chicago Service Center. This all took a bit. So they picked up my car on Feb 11th It got to the service center on Monday the 13th. They texted me that morning to sign the service approval doc and that a technician would be assigned. Took until Thursday the 16th for a technician to be assigned. Then it went into diagnosis status. Today the 20th I asked for an update and they are telling me that an order was placed for a coolant pump and it should be there tomorrow for installation. They said the technician after inspecting the wiring believe the pump has an internal fault resulting in Turtle lite to appear on cluster. The word that worries me is believe! Wanted to see if anyone else has had this experience. I looked and saw post about the turtle mode but none with the Pump issues. Thanks!!!!",2023-02-20,-5.0,,Air Touring,95.0

They get the benefit of the doubt, but not indefinitely. Their runway is getting shorter and shorter as they age and more competition is teased or comes to reality. They need to pray they have the time to ""heal all things"" Lucid. That is not a given. Their improvement needs to be on a level that discourages potential customers from passing on Lucid in favor of something more stable. It isn't just the software. New car reliability, access to service, range, etc. all weigh in. Lucid needs to take the software out of the ""Con"" column sooner rather than later. Lucid is very lucky both BMW and Mercedes made such unattractive vehicles. ",2023-02-02,-5.0,,Air GT,86.0

Something like the Rivian efficiency graph.


Instead we got less information. Range for me continues to be estimated based on 3.7 miles per kWh. I have never gotten that efficiency. Over 13k miles I am at 2.9 Average. 

Using the EPA number to estimate my remaining range is not only unhelpful, but dangerous. I’ve gone over 200 miles with cruise set at 70 mph and not gotten 3.7 miles per kWh. Perhaps in some ideal circumstance the car can get 3.7. I haven’t seen it. 

Why is my range not calculated by efficiency over last 25 or 50 miles? I started at 80% so first 99 miles of this charge I got 2.8 miles kWh. Not 3.7.",2022-11-07,-7.0,40.0,Air Pure,90.0

The car warned incessantly that the frunk was open, though it was not. Electronically opening and closing the frunk didn’t silence the error. Physically pushing down on the frunk finally convinced the car that the frunk was closed.

2. Got on the highway a few minutes later. The car accelerated to 36 mph and no higher. Terrifying!

Are these faults related? I’m aware of rumors of a “turtle mode”; is there any official acknowledgement or documentation of such a thing?

There is no warning or indication. The car simply refuses to accelerate past 36 mph. I did a reset via X+microphone+brake, but no change. It’s Sunday, so no one will begin to consider the issue till tomorrow.

(I know that many here dislike angry complaints about Lucid and respond defensively, but I am irate. For the second time, I have an undrivable car. Last time it was in the repair shop for three weeks. What a mistake this was.)",2023-02-05,-7.0,,Air GT,95.0
